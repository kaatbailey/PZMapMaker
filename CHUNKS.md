# pzformat — Chunk index and prompts

Companion to `CHARTER.md` and `STATE.md`. This file holds the work breakdown and
the ready-to-paste prompt for each chunk.

---

## How to run a chunk

1. Open a new session.
2. Paste, in this order: **`CHARTER.md`**, then **`STATE.md`**, then **the one
   chunk prompt** you are working on, then **the `FINDINGS` block from the
   chunk you just finished** if it is listed as an input.
3. Work the chunk. Do not start the next one.
4. At the end, the session writes a `FINDINGS` block in the format at the bottom
   of this file.
5. You fold the findings into `STATE.md` — adding, never deleting — and tick the
   chunk here.

**Never paste more than one chunk prompt.** A session that can see three chunks
will half-do all three and hand you back something none of them defined as done.

**Why prompts are short and the charter is long:** the charter is the part that
must survive; the prompt is disposable. If a future session only reads one
document, it should be the charter.

## Chunk index

Status: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked

### Track A — Library. Architecture-independent, useful whatever the UI becomes.

| | Chunk | Depends on | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | **A1** Verify `outlineRoom` wall placement | — | **CLOSED 2026-08-10. Offsets CORRECT** (STATE §18) |
| | **A2** Remove superseded vegetation code | — | **RE-SCOPED into A2a/A2b/A2c** (STATE §20) |
| `[!]` | **A2a** Delete `TreeScatter` / `TreePalette` | A2-gate | **BLOCKED** — tree ownership unresolved (STATE §25) |
| `[x]` | **A2b** Stop writing `WorldGenOverride.lua` | — | **Confirmed inert in game 2026-08-11.** Write still to be deleted |
| `[ ]` | **A2c** Authored trees vs engine biome vegetation | A2-gate | Open question, not cleanup |
| `[ ]` | **A2-gate** Settle tree ownership | — | **A written decision.** Positional test in game |
| `[ ]` | **A3** Auto wall-joining | A1, A3-pre1, A3-pre2, E9 | `WallJoin` + tests. **Inherits E9's neighbour-rule engine** — do not write a second one |
| `[ ]` | **A3-pre1** Fix `edgeOf` decoration fallback | — | Small. `attachedN` proxy is reachable via a public method |
| `[ ]` | **A3-pre2** Confirm tileset variant cycle | — | Small. Wall-joining picks by position, not flags alone |
| `[ ]` | **A4** Validation rule engine | A1, A3 | `Validator` + rule set. **Must work at 1×N** (STATE §19) |
| `[ ]` | **A5** TMX read/write | A1 | Interop, checked against Unjammer corpus |
| `[ ]` | **A6** `.tiles` writer | — | Writer + round-trip |
| `[ ]` | **A7** `objects.lua` read/write | — | Parser, writer, room-type link |

### Track B — Buildings. Evidence first, then a decision, then code.

| | Chunk | Depends on | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ ]` | **B1** Vanilla house anatomy | — | **A document. No code.** |
| `[ ]` | **B2** `StaticModule.prefab` decision gate | B1 | **A written decision.** |
| `[!]` | **B3** Room decomposition | B2 | Blocked — cannot be written until B2 resolves |
| `[!]` | **B4** Openings: doors and windows | B3 | Blocked |
| `[!]` | **B5** Roofs | B3 | Blocked |
| `[ ]` | **B6** Room typing and loot tables | B1, A7 | Named room types in output |

### Track C — Application. Local single-user desktop editor.

| | Chunk | Depends on | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | **C1** Architecture decision gate | — | **A written decision.** |
| `[x]` | **C2** Working store and project format | C1 | **DONE 2026-08-22.** MapProject (enumerate, LRU, atomic save, edit→save→reopen no loss, 36 tests) + Qt6 MainWindow (open map, cell-list dock with search/Ctrl+G, load-on-click, Recent Maps, dirty marker, close guard). STATE §"C1 DONE + C2 UNDERWAY" and §"C2 polish". |
| `[~]` | **C3** Interactive viewport | C1, C2 | **FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE (viewer).** Real PZ sprite art, pan/zoom, level selector (floor-peeling verified on KNOX BANK in 41_37), persistent texturepacks, readable 1:1 default. Known limit: 2048 texture-array-layer cap blanks some sprites on dense cells — interim clamp in place; proper fix = atlas packing. Then C4 (editing). |
| `[~]` | **C4** Tool layer: brushes, selection, undo UI | C3, A3 | **Items 1–4 done 2026-08-25.** Middle-drag pan, right-click floor pickup, green footprint preview, left-click/drag paint stroke, Escape to clear brush — all verified on real Muldraugh data. Painting lands exactly where the outline indicates. Item 5 (tile picker panel) is next. See STATE §"C4 stamp brush + pan". |
| `[!]` | **C5** Shell: panels, tile picker, validation panel | C4, A4 | Blocked |

### Track D — Sustaining.

| | Chunk | Depends on | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ ]` | **D1** Fast round-trip regression | — | Sub-minute suite |
| `[ ]` | **D2** Publish B42 format documentation | — | Public doc |
| `[ ]` | **D3** GIS licensing review and project licence | — | Decision. **Now blocking, not hypothetical:** the OSM/Japan path (2026-08-31) brings ODbL attribution and share-alike. The US path was federal public domain and carried no such duty. Any published OSM-derived map must carry attribution; the generated mod does not. Shipping a generator inside the app is also a different posture than a research script. See STATE §"GIS — Japan/OSM source". |

### Track E — GIS pipeline behaviour. **Scope clarified 2026-08-31:** the GIS generator ships with the application (own window, menu item) as an accessibility path — a playable map for non-technical and disabled users who will not learn TileZed. The editor is still the main work and still wins where the two compete for a session; "side project" no longer implies "not shipped." The **port** of this pipeline to C++ is Track F.

| | Chunk | Depends on | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | **E1** Write zombie density into `chunkGrid` | — | **DONE 2026-08-11, confirmed in game** (STATE §23) |
| `[ ]` | **E2** Calibrate density values | E1 | Values by occupancy class, not one constant. **Caveat 2026-08-31:** on Japanese OSM occupancy class is mostly `Unclassified` (58 of 59 in the first sample). Measure a commercial box before assuming class is available, or Japanese maps get one density everywhere |
| `[x]` | **E3** Ground blending investigation | — | **CLOSED 2026-08-13. Mechanism CONFIRMED** (STATE §26, `docs/E3_GROUND_BLENDING.md`) |
| | **E4** Scene rotation pass | — | **RETIRED 2026-08-14.** Premise fails and it was never needed (STATE §30) |
| `[x]` | **E5** `FootprintSnap` | — | **CLOSED 2026-08-14. Buildings are rectangles** (STATE §31, §32, `docs/e5_buildings.png`) |
| `[x]` | **E14** Room layout inside a rectangle | — | **CLOSED 2026-08-14. A BSP plus a circulation pass** (STATE §34) |
| `[x]` | **E13** Interior subdivision | E5, E14 | **CLOSED 2026-08-19.** Layout engine rewritten, door fix confirmed, in-game walk passed. Houses look correct; barn is open. (STATE §35, §36) |
| `[ ]` | **E6** Extract `BiomeMapWriter` distance banding | — | Small. Three consumers want a region signal |
| `[x]` | **E7** Ground precedence and dither generality | E3 | **CLOSED 2026-08-13. Priority table CONFIRMED** over 4,065 cells (STATE §27, `docs/E7_GROUND_PRECEDENCE.md`) |
| `[x]` | **E8** Region layer and the dither law | E7 | **CLOSED 2026-08-14. The scattered-diamond defect is FIXED** (STATE §28, `docs/e8_final.png`) |
| `[x]` | **E9** Mask pass | E7, E8 | **Shared with A3** — neighbour-rule engine, ground is its first consumer |
| `[ ]` | **E10** Restore dirt, gated to yards and tracks | E8 | Reverses test 27's symptom fix |
| `[ ]` | **E11** Region shape | E9 | Yards read as an 8-10 square apron; vanilla's minority squares form chains, ours are isolates |
| `[ ]` | **E12** Diagonal mask clause | E9 | Small. Extend `MaskAudit` to record diagonal geometry first |
| `[ ]` | **E15** Areal water fill | — | `natural=water` polygons fill rather than trace a perimeter. Small if `fillPolygon` is reusable — buildings already use it. **Confirm the defect before fixing it** (STATE 2026-08-31, UNVERIFIED) |
| `[ ]` | **E16** Landuse import | E15 | `Cover` gains landcover. **Design gate first:** one `LANDCOVER` value with a type field, or distinct `FOREST`/`GRASS`/`PARK`/`FARMLAND`? Then where it slots into the E7 precedence table — CONFIRMED over 4,065 cells and must not be broken |
| `[ ]` | **E17** Road tile variants | E9 | Roads render jaggy; PZ ships corner and edge road tiles. **Inherits E9's neighbour-rule engine** — do not write a second one |

### Track F — GIS pipeline port to C++. The generator ships with the app; it cannot ship in a language the app does not build.

| | Chunk | Depends on | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ ]` | **F1** Inventory and port order | — | **A document, no code.** Every Java GIS file, line count, dependencies, and a SHIPS / SURVEY / DEAD verdict |
| `[ ]` | **F2** `Json` + `GeoJson` | F1 | Dependency-free JSON reader + GeoJSON feature model. Oracle: same file → same features, same properties |
| `[ ]` | **F3** `FootprintSnap` + `BuildingPlan` | F1 | Pure geometry and the layout engine. Oracle: `BuildingPlan`'s own 14,680-layout self-test, ported and matching |
| `[ ]` | **F4** Palettes | F1 | `TilePalette`, `WaterTiles`, `GroundMaterial`. Oracle: same `TileIndex` in → same tile names out |
| `[ ]` | **F5** `GisImport` raster | F2, F3 | `Cover` grid, `fillPolygon`, `thickLine`, `waterLine`, `deriveWalls`, projection. Oracle: identical `Cover` grid compared cell by cell |
| `[ ]` | **F6** `GisCells` writer | F4, F5 | Cells, rooms, doors, `chunkGrid`, spawn points, biome map. **Oracle: byte-identical mod output vs Java** |
| `[ ]` | **F7** GIS window in the Qt app | F6, C3 | Menu item → window: pick GeoJSON, pick output, generate, progress, schematic preview. **This is the accessibility deliverable** — it is what a non-technical user actually touches |
| `[ ]` | **F8** Retire or keep the Java tree | F6, F7 | **A written decision.** Once C++ generates byte-identical output, is the Java tree still the oracle, or archived? |

**Why this order.** Leaves first, so every chunk stands on something already
verified. F2 and F3 are pure functions with no PZ dependencies and the cleanest
oracles. F5 needs both. F6 is last because it is the integration point and holds
the strongest oracle — byte-identical mod output leaves nowhere for an
interpretation bug to hide.

**Already ported — do not re-port.** `CellData`, `LotHeader`, `LotPack`,
`TileDefs`, `TileBin`, `PackFile`, `SpriteNames`, `TileIndex`, `Square`,
`MapValidator`, `CellEditor`, `MapProject`, all verified byte-identical against
Java on retail data. `GisCells` writes *through* these, so the GIS port is pure
logic and palette selection, **not format work**.

**Two traps, both recorded in STATE 2026-08-31.** `Cover` already contains
`WATER` — do not "add" it. And `std::mt19937` will not reproduce
`java.util.Random`; the per-cell seed and position-hash dither (§28) must be
ported as the same LCG or F6's diff will never clear.

---

**E9 was the second charter §2 test, and E5 remains the first:** a GIS feature the editor needs
regardless of who authors the tiles. E4 exists to serve it.

### Suggested order

**A1 → A2 → B1 → B2 → C1**, then the tracks open up in parallel. A1 first
because room geometry is load-bearing for everything in B and C. A2 second
because it is cheap, the evidence is already in hand, and it removes two files
a future session would otherwise have to reason about.

**AMENDED 2026-08-11.** A1 is closed. A2 turned out not to be cheap — its
premise is contested and A2a is blocked on a question nobody had asked. The
order is now:

**AMENDED 2026-08-13.** E3 is closed. It found a confirmed mechanism rather
than a fourth hypothesis, and left one measurement blocking everything
downstream: the material priority table. The order is now:

**AMENDED 2026-08-13.** E7 is closed. Three investigation chunks have run
back to back and nothing on the generated map has changed yet; the defect that
started this — ground reading as scattered tan diamonds — is fully diagnosed
and still present. E8 therefore builds, opening with the one measurement E7
left rather than deferring it to a fourth document chunk. The order is now:

**AMENDED 2026-08-14.** E8 is closed and the defect that started this whole
line of work is fixed. E9 adds the mask layer, which softens the remaining hard
edges between materials — the last piece of §26's four-layer model. The order is
now:

**AMENDED 2026-08-14.** E9 is closed. §26's four-layer model — region,
texture, dither, mask — is complete, and the ground work that began with E3 is
finished and verified in game. The E-track now has only refinements left, so
the next substantial work is the tree-ownership gate that has blocked A2 since
2026-08-11. The order is now:

**AMENDED 2026-08-14.** E5 is closed — buildings are axis-aligned rectangles,
verified by `Probe roomgeom` at 100% and in game. The owner's stated goal is a
real building of the right type on each footprint, and the gap is now interior
subdivision rather than geometry, so E13 comes first:

**AMENDED 2026-08-14.** E13's recipe is measured (STATE §33) — which rooms by
footprint size, how many of each, when to cut a hall, what to add to a parcel
and how near. One piece is missing: how vanilla arranges rooms inside a
rectangle. E14 measures it, then E13 builds.

**AMENDED 2026-08-14.** E14 is closed and E13 is part-built — see its prompt
for exactly what works and what does not. Finishing E13 is the next work:

**E13 (finish) → A2-gate → B1 → B2 → C1**, with E10, E11, E12 and A3-pre1/pre2 available as
small fillers at any point.

**AMENDED 2026-08-19.** E13 is closed — layout engine rewritten to the owner's
architectural rule, door fix confirmed in game, barn classification working.
B3 (room decomposition) and B4 (openings) are largely superseded by E13's
layout engine and door pass; re-scope or close when B1/B2 resolve. The order
is now:

**A2-gate → B1 → B2 → C1**, with E10, E11, E12 and A3-pre1/pre2 available as
small fillers. The A-series leads into the editor (C-track); each chunk builds
the layer the next sits on.

**E3 first (RESOLVED 2026-08-14 — E3, E7 and E8 are closed and the ground defect is fixed; kept as the record of why this line of work came first.)** Ground appearance was the most immersion-breaking defect on the
generated map (owner, 2026-08-11), and E3 was an investigation rather than a
build — the same shape as B1, which the charter's method section says should
come before code.

**A2-gate second** because it is cheap, it unblocks or kills A2a, and leaving
a blocked chunk in the index invites a future session to start it anyway.

## Shared preamble

Every prompt below assumes this, and every prompt written later must include it:

> You have been given `CHARTER.md` and `STATE.md`. Work **only** the chunk
> below. If you find something that belongs to another chunk, record it in
> FINDINGS under "Noticed, out of scope" and do not act on it.
>
> Do not rewrite `CHARTER.md`. Do not delete anything from `STATE.md`.
>
> Before writing code: state your approach, name the check that would prove it
> wrong, and run that check. Patches are delivered as Python scripts that abort
> unless each anchor matches exactly once. The shell is fish — no heredocs. Run
> everything from `~/Documents/PZMapCreation`.
>
> **The owner runs every command.** You have no access to the repo, the PZ
> install, or the game. Give exact commands with real paths — angle-bracket
> placeholders have twice been read by fish as redirections.

### Standing environment notes

Added 2026-08-11 after each of these cost real time.

### `$GISMAP` empties between shells — set it in the same command

Fish variables do not survive a new shell, and an empty `$GISMAP` fails
*differently* every time, which is why it has cost three separate round trips:

```
NoSuchFileException: 200_200/200_201.lotheader     # cell name read as a path
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 3            # argument count short by one
(nothing at all)                                   # under 2>/dev/null
```

None of those says "the variable is empty". Set it in the same command block as
whatever uses it:

```fish
set GISMAP ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport
java -cp out pzformat.Probe roomgeom "$PZ/media" $GISMAP 200_201
```

`Probe roomgeom` prints rect coordinates only in its *excluded* branch, so once
rooms are axis-aligned there is nothing to grep for them. Use
`Probe findprop "$PZ/media" $GISMAP CELL WallN` to locate a building instead —
its 3-hit cap is exactly right for that.

### `Probe findprop` finds an example, never all of them

`PropsProbe.find` is hard-capped at **3 hits per cell**. Used to build a rate or
a distribution it returns a clean, plausible, entirely void number — a 3-square
sample cannot produce a run longer than 1, which is how a dither test came back
"100% width 1" for a cell already measured by hand to be dithered. It agreed
with the hypothesis under test, which is why it nearly got through.

For a census use `pzformat.GroundCensus`, which walks every square of every
named cell in one JVM run:

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.GroundCensus "$PZ/media" "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY" 42_40 35_35
```

Whole map, roughly 100 seconds:

```fish
set cells (for f in "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"/*.lotheader; basename $f .lotheader; end)
java -cp out pzformat.GroundCensus "$PZ/media" "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY" $cells > ~/Downloads/census.txt
```

Note `ls | xargs -n1 basename` breaks on the space in "Muldraugh, KY" — it
splits the path and yields a bogus cell named `Muldraugh,`. Use the fish loop.

### GREP RULE — no exceptions

**`grep` is aliased to `ugrep`.** Write every pattern with its own `-e`.
Always, even for a single pattern. Never write `\|` in a grep pattern.

```fish
# CORRECT — one -e per pattern
grep -rn -e chunkGrid -e GRID_BYTES src/main/java/pzformat/

# WRONG — ugrep is POSIX-strict, so this searches for the literal
# string "chunkGrid|GRID_BYTES" and silently finds nothing
grep -rn 'chunkGrid\|GRID_BYTES' src/main/java/pzformat/
```

**Why this is a rule and not a note.** The failure is silent — an empty result
looks exactly like "the symbol is not there." On 2026-08-11 this produced two
false negatives that sent a session down the wrong path, once concluding a
class did not reference symbols it plainly did. The session then wrote a
warning about it into two documents and emitted `\|` again twice in the same
sitting. Knowing the hazard does not prevent it; using `-e` unconditionally
does.

**Also:** `ugrep` aborts the entire command if any named file is missing, so
one guessed filename kills the search of the files that do exist. Name files
you have confirmed exist, or search a directory.

Same class as the `ls`/eza gotcha in STATE §5.

- **The two GIS commands are in STATE §6.** `gisimport` writes a schematic
  PNG; `giscells` writes the mod. Not interchangeable. They were recovered
  from shell history three times in one session before being written down.
- **`Probe` argument shapes vary.** `lotheader` takes a *file*; `square`,
  `findprop` and `roomgeom` take a media dir *plus* a map dir.
- **`Probe survey` takes ~90s on Muldraugh** and, piped through `grep`,
  prints nothing until it finishes. Warn before long runs; it is not hung.
- **In-game tests need a fresh world**, not a resumed save — spawn and chunk
  data get baked for territory already visited.

### Path reference — where things live

These paths have each cost at least one round trip to rediscover. Put them here
rather than in STATE so they survive even if STATE is not uploaded.

```
Project repo:          ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
Compiled classes:      ~/Documents/PZMapCreation/out
GIS source data:       ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson, roads.geojson, area.geojson
Generated mod output:  ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport/
Vanilla PZ install:    ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid/
Vanilla maps:          $PZ/media/maps/Muldraugh, KY/
Decompiled engine:     ~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/
```

### Regeneration command

The entry point is `Probe giscells`, NOT `GisCells` (which has no `main`).
This has cost two round trips.

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
set PZ ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid
set GISMAP ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport

java -cp out pzformat.Probe giscells \
    ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson \
    ~/pzgis/roads.geojson \
    ~/pzgis/area.geojson \
    "$PZ/media" \
    ~/Zomboid/mods \
    PZGisImport
```

### Common probe commands

```fish
# Room distribution on generated output
java -cp out pzformat.RoomCluster "$GISMAP" 200_200 200_201 201_200 201_201

# Room wall geometry
java -cp out pzformat.Probe roomgeom "$PZ/media" "$GISMAP" 200_200

# Inspect a specific square
java -cp out pzformat.Probe square "$PZ/media" "$GISMAP" 200_200 117 91 0

# Door pre-flight (coordinates change per generation)
java -cp out pzformat.DoorProbe "$PZ/media" "$GISMAP" 200_201 43 69 43 84

# Vanilla measurement (full Muldraugh)
set cells (for f in "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"/*.lotheader; basename $f .lotheader; end)
java -cp out pzformat.RoomCluster "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY" $cells
```

# Track A prompts

## A1 — Verify `outlineRoom` wall placement  ✅ CLOSED 2026-08-10

> **RESULT: the offsets are CORRECT.** South wall sits at `ry+rh`, east at
> `rx+rw` — the next square out, as `outlineRoom` assumed. Two independent
> lines: vanilla measurement across 86 rooms in 42_40 (south `ry+rh` 67.0%
> vs `ry+rh-1` 10.2%, a 6.6x margin; east 83.9% vs 3.7%, 22.4x), and source
> inspection of `CellEditor.outlineRoom`. Worked example
> `weldingworkshop [57,169 12x12]` matched all four corners including the
> empty far corner at `(rx+rw, ry+rh)`. Full detail in STATE §18.
>
> **The instrument already existed.** `Probe roomgeom` had made the
> measurement and STATE §10 recorded it; the open thread in §2 was stale
> when written. *Check what this project already does, not only what vanilla
> does.*
>
> **A3, A4 and A5 are unblocked.**

The original prompt follows, kept so a later session can see what was asked.

**Why this is first.** `outlineRoom` places north walls at `y0+h` and west walls
at `x0+w`, the far edges belonging to the *next* square out. That follows from
edge-based walls, but it is **reasoning, not measurement** — and unmeasured
reasoning is what produced the x/y transposition and the `attachedN` bug, two of
the eight bugs that got through the test suite. Every building and every editor
room-drawing tool sits on this.

**Scope.** Take real rooms from vanilla Muldraugh. Read their actual wall
positions off the map data. Compare against what `outlineRoom` generates for the
same rectangle. Fix it or confirm it.

**Method.**
- Use `Probe square` and `Probe findprop` against `"$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"`.
  `RoomGeometry` already measured wall offsets across 86 rooms — reuse that
  rather than re-deriving it, but treat its conclusion as the hypothesis under
  test, not as the answer.
- Predict the wall coordinates before dumping them.
- Test more than one room shape. A square room can be right by accident where an
  L-shape or a 1-tile-wide room is wrong.
- Test a room on a cell boundary if one exists — that is where an off-by-one
  becomes a cross-cell bug.

**Definition of done.** For at least five vanilla rooms of differing shapes, the
walls `outlineRoom` would generate match the walls actually present, or the
discrepancy is characterised exactly and fixed. A self-test encodes the result.

**Falsification.** If your check cannot distinguish "walls at `y0+h`" from
"walls at `y0+h-1`", it is not a check. Say what output each hypothesis predicts
before you look.

**Non-goals.** Do not build room *creation* UI, do not touch building
generation, do not refactor `RoomGeometry`.

## A2 — Remove superseded vegetation code  ⚠ RE-SCOPED 2026-08-10/11

> **Do not run this prompt as written.** Investigation split it into three
> pieces that are not interchangeable, and one of them is blocked. See
> A2a / A2b / A2c / A2-gate below. STATE §20 and §25.
>
> **What went wrong with the original scoping.** The prompt assumed the two
> deletions were independent and both safe. Neither held:
>
> - `BiomeMapWriter` depends on `TreeScatter.distanceToStructure`, which is
>   grid geometry rather than vegetation placement. Deleting the class
>   outright breaks the biome map — the thing that most recently worked.
> - Whether the engine actually discards our authored trees is **not
>   established**, and two findings point against it.
>
> A session on 2026-08-10 ran `grep`, found live callers, and wrongly
> concluded A2's premise was false; "superseded" means the engine discards
> the output, not that the code is unreachable. A different session then
> wrote the opposite claim into STATE §21 and had to retract it. **Both
> errors came from reasoning about the engine instead of observing it.**

The original prompt follows, kept for the record.

**Context.** `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette` place ~7,800 trees that
`genMapSquare` deletes on load (STATE §9 — the engine owns TREE/BUSH/PLANT and
replaces them per tile from the biome map). `WorldGenOverride.lua` is still
written and is superseded by the biome map on authored chunks.

**Scope.** Delete both, stop writing `WorldGenOverride.lua`, regenerate, and
**prove in game that nothing changed.**

**Method.** The proof is the point, not the deletion. Before deleting, predict
what the square dump and the in-game view will show afterwards. Then:

- Regenerate the mod and diff the square dumps before/after. Authored trees
  should be the only difference.
- Load in game and check vegetation, the biome gradient, and the cell boundary
  seam. All three should be unchanged.

**Definition of done.** Both classes gone, `WorldGenOverride.lua` no longer
written, self-tests pass, and an in-game observation recorded confirming the
gradient and seam are unchanged.

**Falsification.** If in-game vegetation *does* change, the belief in STATE §9
is wrong and that is a far more valuable result than the cleanup. Record it in
the Corrections table and stop.

**Non-goals.** Do not improve the biome map while you are in there. Do not touch
`GroundPalette`.

## A2-gate — Settle tree ownership

**Deliverable is a written decision.** One in-game observation. No code.

**Why this exists.** A2a rests on the claim that the engine discards our
authored trees. That claim is not established, and A2a would delete the code
that places 7,797 of them.

**Evidence for** (STATE §9, §11): `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces
TREE/BUSH/PLANT per tile on load, and the engine substitutes species art for
our generic `vegetation_trees_01_*` tiles — so beautiful varied trees in game
are compatible with our writing generic ones.

**Evidence against** (STATE §25): `BiomeMapWriter`'s own scope note says
WorldGen only generates chunks where `hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()` is true,
and `GisCells` fills every square — so WorldGen may never run on our chunks.
And our tree tiles are demonstrably in the lotpack.

These are not necessarily contradictory: `genMapSquare` and WorldGen chunk
generation are different mechanisms and one could run while the other does
not. That ambiguity is what `BiomeMapWriter` itself flags as UNVERIFIED.

**Method.** Positional. Get authored tree coordinates from the generated
cell, convert to world coordinates, walk that line in game.

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe findprop "$PZ/media" \
    ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport 200_200 tree
```

World coordinate for cell 200_200 local (x,y) is `(51200 + x, 51200 + y)`.
**Use interior squares — cell-local x roughly 120–180.** A first attempt used
local x=0, which is world x=51200 and sits on the map edge.

**Definition of done.** One of three answers, recorded with the coordinates
checked:

- Trees at exactly those coordinates, bare ground between → **positions are
  ours. A2a is killed** and `TreeScatter` is load-bearing.
- Trees along the line at unrelated positions → **the engine re-scatters.
  A2a proceeds.**
- Dense forest everywhere → the engine adds on top of ours; say so and
  propose a different test rather than guessing.

**Falsification.** Predict which of the three you expect before looking, and
say why. Note that 7,797 trees over four cells is ~3% of squares, and the
forest in the 2026-08-11 screenshots looks denser than that — canopy overlap
could explain it, or the engine adding trees could.

**Non-goals.** Do not delete anything. Do not touch `GroundPalette`.

---

## A2a — Delete `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette`  🚫 BLOCKED

**Blocked on A2-gate.** Do not start.

When unblocked, note that the deletion is **not wholesale**:
`BiomeMapWriter` calls `TreeScatter.distanceToStructure`, which is grid
geometry. Extract it to a helper first — that move should be byte-identical
on its own, which makes it a separately provable step. Proof mechanism is
hash-before/hash-after plus an in-game check; the lotpacks are *expected* to
differ, so the claim under test is "the loaded map is identical", not "the
output is identical".

---

## A2b — Stop writing `WorldGenOverride.lua`  ✅ CONFIRMED INERT 2026-08-11

> **RESULT: the file does nothing.** Moved out of the generated mod
> directory and loaded in game: **no seam, foliage flows cleanly across the
> boundary** — dense mixed forest one side, open grass with saplings the
> other, trees crossing coherently. The biome map is doing that work.
>
> **Remaining:** delete the write at `GisCells:220` and the
> `writeWorldGenOverride` method. Trivial, and safe on this evidence.

## A2c — Authored trees vs engine biome vegetation

Open question, not cleanup. Depends on A2-gate.

Biomes drive vegetation in engine-generated terrain, and we also write tree
tiles into authored cells. Do both target the same squares? If the engine
populates authored cells too, vegetation is being decided twice by different
rules, and which one wins matters before the editor authors vegetation
deliberately. Full prompt when A2-gate resolves.

---

## A3 — Auto wall-joining

**Depends on A1** (closed) **and on A3-pre1 and A3-pre2.** Both prerequisites
are small and both are upstream of the join algorithm — cheaper to do first
than to discover halfway through.

> **The wall vocabulary is CONFIRMED** (STATE §19) and A3 can rely on it:
>
> | Flag | Role | `edgeOf` |
> |---|---|---|
> | `WallW` / `WallN` | west / north edge | WEST / NORTH |
> | `WallNW` | corner, both segments on one square | BOTH |
> | `WallSE` | **pillar/post** (`PaintingType = pillar`), owns no edge | NONE |
> | `WindowN/W`, `DoorWallN/W` | openings in a wall | NORTH / WEST |
>
> **No diagonal wall primitive exists.** `Facing` is an OBJECT property
> (N/S/E/W, ~6,200 tiles); no wall tile carries it. Objects have four
> facings; walls have two edges plus a corner and a post.

### A3-pre1 — Fix the `edgeOf` decoration fallback

`TileIndex.edgeOf`'s final block falls back to `attachedN`/`attachedW` for
tiles with no `Wall*` flag — **the exact proxy its own comment warns
against**, and the one that validated at 99.5% while being wrong (STATE §11).
It is unreachable from `wallOn`, which gates on `isStructuralWall` first, so
A1's measurement is unaffected. But `edgeOf` is public and A3 will call it on
neighbours, where a grime overlay would report `Edge.NORTH`.

Return NONE for attached-only tiles, or split the fallback into a separate
`decorationEdge()` so a caller has to ask for it deliberately.

### A3-pre2 — Confirm the tileset variant cycle

The per-tile flags say *which edge*; they do not say corner vs end vs
junction. In `walls_exterior_house_01` the observed pattern is
`WallW, WallN, WallNW, WallSE` every 4, with openings every 16. Confirm that
cycle holds across other tilesets before A3 designs around it — if it is a
per-tileset accident rather than a convention, the join algorithm needs a
different input.

**Context.** All the information needed is already present: `TileIndex` and
`Square` resolve walls, and `.tiles` carries facing. What is missing is choosing
the *right variant* when a wall is placed — corner, end, T-junction, straight.
This is a headline feature the official tools handle poorly.

**Scope.** Given a placed wall and its neighbours, select the correct wall tile
variant. Update neighbours when a wall is added or removed.

**Method.** Read vanilla first. Find a house corner, a T-junction and a wall end
in Muldraugh with `Probe square`, and record which tiles vanilla uses in each
case. The tileset's own naming and facing properties are the recipe; do not
infer the variant set from what looks right in a render.

**Definition of done.** Placing a wall run around a rectangle in `CellEditor`
produces the same tile choices vanilla uses for an equivalent structure, and
removing one wall re-joins its neighbours correctly. Undo still restores
byte-identical output.

**Falsification.** Re-derive the variant for a wall you did not use to build the
rule, in a different tileset. If the rule only works on the tileset it was
derived from, it is a lookup table, not a rule.

**Non-goals.** No UI. No doors or windows — fixtures mount in walls and have
their own chunk.

---

## A4 — Validation rule engine

**Depends on A1** (closed) **and A3.** This is the chunk that makes the
charter's competitive claim true, so it should not be rushed to a thin
version.

> **DESIGN CONSTRAINT discovered 2026-08-10** (STATE §19). A corpus sweep of
> all 4065 cells found **152,317 room rects, of which 80.3% are under 4 on a
> side and 46,482 are one square wide.** Vanilla rooms are decomposed into
> thin strips.
>
> **Any rule reasoning about a rect's interior is inapplicable to four-fifths
> of the corpus. A4 must work at 1×N.** This constrains the design more than
> the orientation question does.
>
> **Room membership comes only from lotheader rects.** The per-square room id
> is `-1` on every vanilla interior square sampled (STATE §18), so A4 needs a
> spatial index over `RoomDef` rects built per cell — the same index
> `FootprintSnap` (E5) needs.
>
> **Multi-storey rooms repeat per level.** `prisoncells [193,203 5x54]`
> appears identically at z=0,1,2,3, so vertical connectivity is a separate
> question from horizontal for "room with no exit".
>
> **An "expressible as a room rect" rule belongs here**, and a working
> prototype exists in `RoomGeometry.alignment()` — but it took four attempts
> to stop false-positiving on vanilla, and it cannot test rects under 4 on a
> side. Read STATE §19's table of what failed before rebuilding it.

**Scope.** A `Validator` that walks a cell and reports structural problems with
coordinates: doorway with no adjacent floor, room with no exit, wall gap that is
not a door, floor at z>0 with nothing beneath, room rectangle overlapping
another, square with no object at z=0 (the chunk gate from STATE §7).

**Method.**
- **Run it against vanilla Muldraugh first.** Vanilla is hand-authored and
  correct-by-construction; a rule that fires on hundreds of vanilla squares is a
  wrong rule, not a discovery. Tune against the 4065-cell corpus.
- Report rates over the population that can discriminate. A rule that cannot
  fire on most squares will look impressively clean for no reason.
- Each rule needs a severity: error (map will not work) vs warning (probably a
  mistake).

**Definition of done.** The rule set runs clean, or with characterised and
explained exceptions, across a sample of vanilla cells; and it correctly flags
each problem in a deliberately broken test cell.

**Falsification.** For every rule, construct the broken case *and* confirm the
rule fires on it. A rule never observed firing is not known to work.

**Non-goals.** No UI panel. No auto-fix. Report only.

## A5 / A6 / A7 — stubs

Write the full prompt when the chunk comes up, using the shape above.

- **A5 TMX read/write.** Interop boundary with the official tools.
  `Unjammer/PZ_Vanilla_map_b42` is the whole vanilla map already decompiled to a
  WorldEd project — an independent regression corpus. Parse a cell, compare
  against their TMX for the same coordinates. Depends on A1 because room
  rectangles cross the boundary.
- **A6 `.tiles` writer.** Reader is confirmed on 73,644 tiles. Writer is needed
  for custom tile properties.
- **A7 `objects.lua` read/write.** Currently `{}`; vanilla's is 4 MB. Likely
  connected to room loot tables, so pair with B6.

# Track B prompts

## B1 — Vanilla house anatomy

**Deliverable is a document, not code.** If this chunk produces Java, it has
failed. Three multi-session detours have come from building before reading.

**Scope.** Pick three vanilla Muldraugh houses of different sizes. Using
`Probe square` and `Probe findprop`, write down exactly how a PZ house is
constructed:

- Floor tiles by room type, and how they change between rooms
- Wall tiles: exterior vs interior, material variation, corner handling
- Where doors sit relative to the wall edge; interior vs exterior door tiles
- Windows: tile, placement rules, height
- Roof: which z-levels, which tiles, how overhang works, what happens at eaves
- Room rectangles: how an L-shaped house decomposes; how many rooms per building
- Room *names* actually used, and the `objects.lua` entries alongside them
- Anything at z=-1

**Definition of done.** A markdown document a future session can build from
without opening the game — with tile names, coordinates, and at least one
worked example per structure. Contradictions between the three houses are
recorded as contradictions, not averaged away.

**Falsification.** For each claim, note whether it held in all three houses or
only one. A pattern from a single house is a hypothesis.

**Non-goals.** No generator design. No opinions on how *we* should build houses.

---

## B2 — `StaticModule.prefab` decision gate

**Deliverable is a written decision with evidence attached.** Not code.

**Context.** Building generation has an open fork that has been open for three
sessions and must not be decided on vibes:

- **Room-splitting generator** — we author the geometry. The editor can then
  inspect, validate and undo it. Consistent with the charter's semantic layer.
- **`StaticModule.prefab`** — the engine's own structure placement mechanism.
  Never tried, never read. The engine assembles at load time, which may mean the
  editor cannot inspect or validate what the player will see.

**Scope.** Read `StaticModule` and everything it touches in the decompiler
(`~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/`, Vineflower at
`~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/vineflower.jar`; `grep -rl StaticModule
--include='*.class'` finds it). Answer:

1. What does a prefab consist of on disk, and where does the engine read it?
2. Does vanilla use it? For what? Find a call site.
3. Does it run on authored chunks, or only procedural ones? (Compare with the
   `genMapChunk` / `genRandomChunk` split in STATE §7.)
4. Can authored map data reference a prefab, or is it WorldGen-only?
5. Is prefab output inspectable from map data, or only after load?

**Definition of done.** A decision — room generator, prefab, or both with a
stated boundary — with the answers above and their evidence. Question 5 is
decisive for the editor: if prefab output cannot be inspected from map data, the
editor cannot validate it, and that outweighs any convenience.

**Falsification.** Note which answers came from reading code and which from
inference. Any inference gets flagged UNVERIFIED in STATE.

**Non-goals.** Do not implement either path.

## B6 — Room typing and loot tables

Depends on B1 and A7. Generic `"room"` gives no loot tables, so a generated map
is unplayable regardless of how good the geometry is. Full prompt when it comes
up.

# Track C prompts

## C1 — Architecture decision gate

**Deliverable is a written decision.** Not code, not a prototype.

**Constraints already fixed by the charter — do not re-litigate:**

- Local, single-user. **No multi-user concurrent editing** (decided
  2026-08-08 — the official tools don't support it and there's no demand).
- The library layer stays dependency-free **C++20** (std library only). The
  application layer may take permissive/LGPL dependencies (Qt6/OpenGL are the
  post-port working assumption).
- Reads assets from the user's PZ install. Ships no TIS art.
- Runs on Linux. Development is Garuda + CLion.

**Decide, with reasons:**

1. **UI toolkit — DECIDED by the 2026-08-21 port: Qt6 Widgets + OpenGL 4.6**
   (native KDE; the toolkit TileZed/QGIS/Qt Creator use). The earlier Java
   options (Spring Boot browser canvas, LWJGL/libGDX) are moot. C1's remaining
   job is to WRITE DOWN this decision with its render falsifier, not to re-pick
   the toolkit. Weigh against: Knox County ~1,300 cells, B42 negative
   z-levels, a naive per-tile draw dies immediately. Instanced draw, atlas
   array textures, two-tier LOD, and mmap chunk streaming are needed from day
   one — estimate the frame budget and name the number that rules the approach
   out before building the shell.
2. **Working store.** SQLite, chunked binary, or the game's own format as the
   live format. Thousands of TMX files is not a working store — TMX stays an
   interop boundary (A5).
3. **Where undo lives.** `CellEditor` has an in-memory grouped journal that
   restores byte-identical output. Does it persist across sessions, and if so,
   in what?
4. **Process boundary.** One process or two, and what crosses.

**Definition of done.** A document giving the choice, the alternatives
considered, and — for each — what would make it the wrong choice. That last part
matters: it is what lets a future session recognise a mistake instead of
inheriting it.

**Falsification.** For the rendering choice specifically, estimate the frame
budget for a full viewport of tiles before choosing, and say what number would
rule the option out. Don't discover it after building the shell.

**Non-goals.** No prototype. No scaffolding. No dependency added to the library.

## C2–C5 — stubs

C1 is resolved (Qt6 + game-format store). C2 is DONE. C3's render gate is
measured and cleared. C4/C5 shapes only:

- **C2 Working store and project format. DONE 2026-08-22.** Delivered: open,
  edit, save, reopen without loss; atomic temp+rename crash safety; LRU cache
  that never evicts dirty cells; Qt6 shell with cell search, dirty markers, and
  a close-with-unsaved guard. Verified on real Muldraugh (4065 cells). See
  STATE and harness/FINDINGS_harness_2026-08-22.md (the C3 gate run).
- **C3 Interactive viewport.** Pan, zoom, z-level switching, layer visibility.
  Streaming and atlas caching per C1's numbers.
- **C4 Tool layer.** Brushes, rectangle select, floor fill, wall draw (using
  A3), delete. Undo/redo bound to the UI on top of `CellEditor`'s journal.
- **C5 Shell.** Tile picker driven by the semantic layer — search by *property*,
  not filename. Validation panel from A4, click-to-navigate. Room inspector.

## E13 — Interior subdivision  `[~]` PART-BUILT

**Do not start over.** Most of this chunk works and is verified. One algorithm
in the middle of it does not. STATE §35 is the full record; this is the short
version.

**Read first:** STATE §35 (this chunk's state), §34 (layout and area ratios),
§33 (the recipe and the hall rule), §31 (buildings are rectangles).

## What already works — leave it alone

- **Typed rooms** written to the lotheader, room membership stamped per square.
  `RoomCluster` on our own map reads back ~44 rooms across 8 buildings.
- **Interior walls**, one per boundary, correct square and orientation (§18).
- **Doors on a SPANNING TREE**, so no room can be walled in. Structural, not
  probabilistic. A4 should walk the same graph in reverse.
- **Exterior doors**, verified in the data at 200_201 (43,69) and (43,84).
  Invisible in a render because `CellRenderer` draws the wall over them — that
  is the renderer, not the map.
- **The house grammar**, measured against 283 vanilla houses: the exterior door
  never opens into a bedroom (1 of 229), the livingroom faces the road, the
  kitchen is opposite, and **the livingroom/kitchen boundary is usually OPEN**
  (55.4% fully open, only 8.2% fully walled).
- **The aspect fix in `split`** — try both axes, keep the better worst-case
  aspect. Took the worst room from 7.0 to 4.0.
- **Room minimums, measured** (`RoomMinimums`): bedroom 3×3, bathroom 2 short,
  livingroom 4 short, kitchen 3 short. All four required rooms appear in houses
  as small as 30 squares.

## What to finish

**1. The room-list loop.** The rule, from the owner:

> livingroom, kitchen, bathroom and at least one bedroom are REQUIRED and have
> minimum sizes. Further bedrooms are added until the space runs out. Closets,
> laundry and storage are the LEFTOVER, not peers with targets.

The prototype produces three bathrooms for three bedrooms, and stops growing
past ~173 squares so a 500 m² house gets 13 rooms at 32% fill. **Vanilla has
about one bathroom per house at these sizes.** The minimums are right; the loop
that consumes them is not.

**2. Place the core as a BLOCK, not a band.** `plan` still gives the livingroom
the full frontage, so a 30×6 building gets a 30×2 livingroom at aspect 15.0.
**The self-test fails on exactly this case and should stay failing until it is
fixed.** Give the core a share of the frontage with a secondary room beside it.

**3. Elastic resize.** "If you need two more feet to make the bedrooms 10×10,
extend that part of the house." Nothing does this; rooms land wherever the
partition puts them.

## Definition of done

- `java -cp out pzformat.BuildingPlan` passes, including the aspect check.
- `RoomCluster` on our own map shows a rooms-per-building distribution and type
  sets resembling vanilla's, and about **one bathroom per house**.
- **The in-game test, which has never been run.** The doors exist in the data
  and nobody has walked through one.

## Falsification

Predict the room counts and the bathroom-per-house figure before running
`RoomCluster` on our output. Name what a house with the right rooms and the
wrong proportions looks like — it is not the same failure as one with the wrong
rooms, and only one of them shows up in a render.

## Do not

- Do not re-measure the minimums, the grammar, or the hall rule.
- Do not rewrite the spanning-tree door pass. It is correct and it is what A4
  inherits.
- Do not attempt multi-storey. The rules are recorded in §35; nothing writes at
  z=1 and stairs do not exist.

## E2 / E4 / E5 / E6 / E10 / E11 / E12 / E14 — stubs

- **E2 Calibrate density.** 2 near buildings is at the low end of vanilla's
  0–10 range, and seven buildings is a hamlet, not a town. The import already
  distinguishes `Agriculture` from `Residential` and treats them alike.
  Measure how vanilla's nonzero density relates to what a place is — and
  prefer the engine's spawn code to measuring Muldraugh. **Do not sample the
  vanilla histogram per chunk:** it is a frequency measurement, and density
  clusters around habitation.
- **E4 Scene rotation pass. RETIRED 2026-08-14 (STATE §30.)** The premise was
  that a dominant building grid exists and the scene should be rotated onto
  it. `FootprintAngles` measured the current import: 7 footprints at 37, 61,
  65, 71, 76, 80°, best ±3° window holding **33.3%** of area against the
  predicted "well over half". The falsifier fired exactly as §17 wrote it.
  Rural parcels each square to their own driveway; there is no street grid
  because there is no street. **And it was never needed:** a room is
  `x, y, w, h` with no rotation field, so the target orientation is 0° —
  known in advance, not discoverable. There is nothing to rotate *to*.
  Kept as the record of a prediction that failed usefully. Whole-scene
  rotation may still suit a dense grid town; nothing in the E-track needs it.
- **E5 `FootprintSnap`.** One module, two callers: GIS import and interactive
  authoring. Takes a footprint, returns an **axis-aligned rectangle of
  matching area at the same location**, tagged with the occupancy class the
  import already carries. **Jaggedness cannot occur, because every edge is
  axis-parallel by construction** — it is the symptom of an off-axis edge,
  not a defect in its own right, which is why the road's straight runs are
  clean and only its diagonals stair-step.
  **Outline fidelity is deliberately discarded.** STATE §30: 93% of vanilla
  rooms are ≤3 rects and 64.5% are exactly one, so tracing a real GIS polygon
  would produce buildings *more* complex than vanilla's. The bounding box is
  closer to vanilla than the truth is.
  The editor side is snap-to-90° on rectangle tools; the enforcement point is
  A4's "wall run not expressible as a room rect", which catches hand-painted
  zigzags and imported data alike.
  **Run §30's open check 1 first:** is the axis constraint hard, or a strong
  default with an override? A correct detector looks for a **run** of rects
  each stepping consistently in one direction — the first attempt fired on any
  two thin rects offset by 1 on both axes, which is every L-shaped closet, and
  its 1,334 "diagonal runs" were false positives. The answer decides whether
  the snap may refuse off-axis input outright.
- **E14 Room layout inside a rectangle.** **A document.** The recipe says
  which rooms; it does not say where. Two things unmeasured. **Is it a BSP?**
  A binary space partition leaves a signature — every internal wall spans the
  full width or height of the region it divides. If vanilla is BSP-like a
  recursive split reproduces it exactly; if rooms meet in T-junctions and
  pinwheels, a naive BSP will look subtly wrong. **What are the area ratios by
  type?** A bathroom is small, a livingroom large. If the ratios are stable the
  subdivider can allocate area by type rather than splitting evenly and
  labelling afterwards — the difference between a plausible house and a grid of
  equal boxes. Predict both before running; §30 already found 93% of rooms are
  ≤3 rects and 64.5% exactly one, so a clean partition is the working
  hypothesis.
- **E13 Interior subdivision.** STATE §30: we write **8 rooms for 7
  buildings**, one open box each, where vanilla writes a cluster — bathroom,
  bedroom, livingroom, kitchen, closet. That is what makes a building read as
  a building, and it is what "drop a real building of the right type on the
  footprint" actually requires. The type vocabulary is already measured
  (§30). **Not yet measured: rooms per building and which types co-occur** —
  `LotHeader` rooms carry no building id, so it needs a clustering pass over
  adjacent rooms sharing walls, or reading `objects.lua` (A7).
- **E6 Extract `BiomeMapWriter` distance banding.** Currently inline in the
  pixel loop and discarded. It is a pure function of `dist[gx][gy]` plus a
  bounds check, so extraction is small, and three consumers want a region
  signal. Worth doing regardless of how E3 resolves — but do not wire it to
  `GroundPalette` until E7 settles the priority table. **E3 answered the driver question:** for
  authored cells it is a human painting land use, and for us it is GIS land
  use. There is no hidden algorithm. Distance banding is still worth extracting
  as a signal, but it is not the region driver.
- **E9 Mask pass.** Implements STATE §26's rule. Runs **after** every square's
  material is final — a square's masks depend on its neighbours, so this cannot
  be folded into the per-square roll in `GroundPalette.roll()`. Mask tiles must
  be declared in the `.lotheader` tile table; `GroundPalette.all` currently
  collects solids and tufts only. **Write it as a general neighbour-rule engine,
  not a ground-specific pass** — it is the same shape as A3 auto wall-joining,
  and A3 should inherit it rather than duplicate it. Rename
  `GroundPalette`'s "overlay" to "tuft" here; the collision with mask tiles will
  otherwise cause a misimplementation.
- **E10 Restore dirt.** `dirt` and `dirt_grass` have full 16-tile blocks with
  the same mask vocabulary as the grasses. Test 27 dropped them because
  scattered dirt reads as bare diamonds — correct diagnosis of a symptom.
  Gated to yards, tracks and unpaved roads, bare is right. Depends on E8
  existing to gate against.

## Decision gates resolved 2026-08-10/11

### §17 — building orientation. BOTH CHECKS CLOSED.

**Check 2 (vocabulary): CLOSED.** No diagonal wall primitive exists in the
tile art. This covers the whole corpus, and is the stronger of the two lines.

**Check 1 (does vanilla ever go off-axis): CLOSED, with a stated limit.**
Zero non-aligned rooms among 29,928 testable rects across 4065 cells, using a
test calibrated against a known positive *and* known negatives. The limit:
that is 19.6% of rects; the rest are under 4 on a side and have no interior
for walls to spread across.

**RESOLUTION: `FootprintSnap` REFUSES off-axis footprints, it does not warn.**
An earlier "warn, not refuse" recommendation came from a broken guard and is
retracted (STATE §13, §19).

# Track D — stubs

- **D1 Fast round-trip regression.** Currently ~14 min, which means it doesn't
  get run. Target under a minute for a representative sample, with the full
  4065-cell run kept as an occasional job.
- **D2 Publish B42 format documentation.** PZwiki documents B41 and is wrong for
  B42 on magic bytes, string terminators, cell size, offset width and chunk
  size. The format work is confirmed byte-identical; publishing it is cheap
  goodwill and invites correction from people who know things we don't.
- **D3 Licensing.** Verify GIS dataset terms per state; choose a project licence.

# Track F — prompts

## F1 — Inventory and port order

**Deliverable: a document. No code.**

The Java GIS tree has never been inventoried. Some of it ships, some was
scaffolding for measurements now closed, some is a survey that writes nothing.
Porting all of it would be wrong, and porting the wrong half would be worse.

For every file under `~/Documents/PZMapCreation/src/main/java/pzformat/` that
the generation path touches, record:

- line count
- what it depends on, and what depends on it
- **one verdict of three:** SHIPS (port it), SURVEY (read-only, taught a rule,
  never called at generation time — do not port), DEAD (superseded)
- for SHIPS units, the oracle that will prove the port correct

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
wc -l src/main/java/pzformat/*.java | sort -rn
grep -l -e GisCells -e GisImport -e Probe src/main/java/pzformat/*.java
```

E13's findings put `RoomCluster`, `DoorProbe` and the `*Probe/*Analysis/*Survey`
harnesses in the measurement bucket. STATE's editor-track inventory lists
`RoomShapes`, `RoomMinimums`, `RoomLayout`, `HouseLayouts`, `FootprintAngles`,
`WallCycle` as read-only surveys. Treat those as SURVEY **unless the call trace
shows `GisCells` reaching them** — trust the trace over both lists.

**Done when:** a verdict per file, and a port order naming the oracle for each
SHIPS unit. If the trace surprises you — a survey called at generation time, or
a shipped unit nothing reaches — that is the finding, say so.

---

## F5 — `GisImport` raster

Port the raster: lon/lat → tile projection, `fillPolygon`, `thickLine` (roads),
`waterLine`, `deriveWalls`, the precedence rules (buildings beat roads beat
water beat nothing), and the schematic PNG.

**`Cover` is `{NONE, WATER, ROAD, BUILDING}` in Java already.** Water shipped
2026-08-21. Do not add it; port it.

**The PNG needs image encode, which C++ std does not provide.** STATE deferred
this for `CellRenderer` to keep the library layer dependency-free (Charter §3).
The generator is **app layer**, so `QImage` covers it. If F5 lands before F7,
write the raster and defer the PNG rather than pulling in `stb_image`.

**Oracle:** dump the `Cover` grid from both implementations on the same GeoJSON
and compare **cell by cell**. A count match is not enough — E8's
scattered-diamond defect was a *distribution* bug that a total would have
passed.

**Watch for areal water.** If the water loop walks rings calling `waterLine`
between consecutive points, it traces a perimeter rather than filling, and a
lake comes out as a ring with dry ground inside (STATE 2026-08-31, UNVERIFIED —
E15). Confirm which it does **before** porting the behaviour. If it is the
perimeter bug, port the *correct* behaviour and record that C++ and Java diverge
here deliberately — do not reproduce a defect for the sake of oracle purity, and
do not silently fix it either.

---

## F6 — `GisCells` writer

The integration point: cells, room rects, the door pass, `chunkGrid` zombie
density, spawn points, biome map.

**Do not regress E13's door fix.** `replaceTile` must strip the matching wall
before adding the door. Two wall objects on one edge leaves the plain wall
winning for collision and the door is solid in game — that was a map defect, not
a renderer defect, and it was confirmed by `DoorProbe` before and after plus an
in-game walk.

**RNG must match or nothing will.** `GisCells` seeds `Random` per cell so a cell
regenerates identically regardless of its neighbours, and the dither flip is
driven by a **position hash**, not that sequential `Random` (§28). C++
`std::mt19937` will not reproduce `java.util.Random` — port the LCG explicitly.

**Oracle — the strong one.** Same GeoJSON, both implementations, diff the mod:

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe giscells <args> ~/Zomboid/mods PZ_java
./build/pz_giscells <args> ~/Zomboid/mods PZ_cpp
diff -r ~/Zomboid/mods/PZ_java ~/Zomboid/mods/PZ_cpp
```

**Done when:** byte-identical output on the Ohio dataset **and** a Tokyo dataset.
Two datasets because Ohio is 7 buildings and 1 linear creek; Tokyo is 59
buildings, 17 roads and areal water, and exercises paths Ohio cannot reach.
Not "looks the same in game."

## FINDINGS block format

Every chunk ends by producing this. Paste it into the next session if it is
listed as an input, and fold it into `STATE.md` before starting anything else.

```markdown
## FINDINGS — <chunk id> — <date>

**Status:** complete / partial / blocked

**What was done:**
- …

**Confirmed** (verified against vanilla data, decompiled engine, or in game):
- …

**Unverified** (believed, not tested — say what would test it):
- …

**Corrections** (something in STATE.md is wrong):
- Old claim → what is actually true → evidence

**Files changed:**
- created / modified / deleted, by path

**Commands worth keeping:**
```fish
…
```

**Noticed, out of scope:**
- …

**What the next chunk needs to know:**
- …
```

The **Corrections** and **Unverified** sections are the ones that earn their
keep. Eight bugs got through 224 automated tests, and every one was caught by
comparison against an independent source — a session that records what it
merely *believes*, separately from what it *checked*, is handing the next
session the list of things worth checking.
