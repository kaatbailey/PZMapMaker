# pzformat — AI session handoff

Paste this whole file at the start of a new session. It is the single source of
truth for what this project is, what already exists, what has been proven, and
what comes next. Nothing described here as existing needs to be rebuilt.

---

## 1. What this project is

**The goal is a Project Zomboid map editor that is better than the official
tools** (TileZed / WorldEd / the new WorldZed). Build 42, retail 42.20.

It is a Java library plus toolset — no dependencies, Java 21, 224 self-tests.
Solo project, no CI, no code review. Built in three layers, in this order:

1. **Format layer** — read and write every file PZ uses for map data, verified
   byte-for-byte against the full vanilla dataset. **Done and trustworthy.**
2. **Semantic layer** — know what a tile *means* (wall, door, window, container,
   facing) rather than just which sprite it draws. **Done for the properties
   that matter so far.**
3. **Application layer** — edit maps safely, render them, validate them, and
   generate them. **In progress. This is where all remaining work is.**

---

### PORT IN PROGRESS — Java → C++20 (started 2026-08-21)

The "Java library, Java 21" line above describes the ORIGINAL implementation,
kept at ~/Documents/PZMapCreation and now used as the **port oracle**. Active
development is a C++20 rewrite committed to this repo (PZMapMaker), flat layout,
CMake+Ninja, CLion. Java source is picked up from the PZMapCreation repo; C++
and updated docs are committed here.

**Why C++.** Qt6 Widgets for the desktop UI (the toolkit TileZed/QGIS/Qt Creator
use, native on KDE) and OpenGL 4.6 for the viewport. The performance argument
for leaving the JVM was NOT measured — no interactive viewport existed to
profile — so it is not the stated basis; UI toolkit fit is. Recorded honestly
so a later session does not cite a benchmark that was never run.

**Port verification = §4 independent source.** Every ported unit is checked
against the Java tree, not only its own tests: a shared synthetic input is fed
to both, outputs must be byte-identical, repeated across the full vanilla
dataset. Self-tests alone are NOT sufficient — read and write can share a wrong
assumption and agree (the mirrored-cell bug, §4).

### PNG Renderer

### DECISION 2026-08-21 — CellRenderer / SpriteAtlas deferred (not cut)

The offline PNG renderer (CellRenderer + SpriteAtlas) is DEFERRED, not ported
and not removed. Reasoning, so it is not re-litigated:

- It was always a DEVELOPER DIAGNOSTIC — "a file you can open and compare
  against the in-game map" — never a MapMaker feature. Charter §1 scope test:
  it does not edit, validate, or render a map a human is authoring in the tool.
- Its job (catch interpretation bugs by eye) is now done better by the
  cross-language oracle, which catches them NUMERICALLY and byte-exact. The two
  bugs it historically caught (x/y transposition, jumbo-tree scale) were
  GEOMETRY errors that the coordinate/atlas-index math surfaces without pixels.
- In-game remains the visual backstop; we are not locked out of visual checks.
- It is the first unit needing PNG decode/encode, which the C++ std library does
  not provide. That is an APP-LAYER image dependency (stb_image, or Qt's QImage
  once C3 commits to Qt). Deferring avoids committing the tree to an image lib
  before the viewport picks one.

When C3 (interactive viewport) lands, the render MATH (isometric projection,
painter's order, sprite trim, 2x-pack half-scale) ports then, against whatever
image/GL path Qt provides. The atlas INDEX logic (entry tables, page dropping,
"earlier pack wins", scale-is-per-pack) is pure and could be ported dependency-
free earlier if a validation rule needs it.

### Editor-track inventory (2026-08-21) — what remains vs what is out of scope

PORTED + verified vs Java on retail: LE, LEW, LotHeader, LotPack, TileDefs,
TileBin, PackFile, SpriteNames, CellData, TileIndex, Square, MapValidator.

EDITOR-TRACK, NOT YET PORTED:
- CellEditor (253 lines) — layer-aware editing with undo/redo over CellData.
  This is the core edit loop C1's viewport drives. NEXT.
- SpriteJoin (107 lines) — properties-but-no-pixels join; a candidate 6th
  validation rule. Needs only sprite NAMES (SpriteNames), not the atlas pixels,
  so it is NOT blocked by the CellRenderer deferral.

OUT OF SCOPE for the editor (Charter §2 GIS side-project or read-only surveys):
- Generation palettes: TilePalette, BiomePalette, TreePalette, GroundMaterial,
  WaterTiles, MaskRule, PaletteScan, WorldGenBiomes, WorldGenFeatures.
- Read-only vanilla surveys (taught the rules, write nothing, editor never
  calls): RoomShapes, RoomMinimums, RoomLayout, HouseLayouts, FootprintAngles,
  WallCycle, plus the *Probe/*Analysis/*Survey harnesses.
- GIS plumbing: Json, GeoJson, GisImport, GisCells, and the Gis* / *Rule family.

These are ported only if and when a specific editor feature needs them, per
Charter §2 ("GIS features are worth building only when they teach something the
editor needs, or when they are nearly free").

**Ported and CONFIRMED (2026-08-21):**

| Unit | Verified against |
|---|---|
| LE / LEW | 318 self-checks; Latin-1 byte fidelity |
| MappedFile | new; mmap streaming, no Java equivalent |
| LotHeader | 4065 cells byte-identical, both trees |
| LotPack | 4065 cells / 4,162,560 chunks byte-identical |
| TileDefs | text parse; index formula vs // comments |
| TileBin | 37,060 tiles, binary vs text prop maps identical |
| PackFile | both .pack layouts round-trip; legacy 0xDEADBEEF |
| SpriteNames | 46,540 names, identical count Java vs C++ |

**CORRECTION (moved here, not deleted).** LotPack encoder policy was assumed
SPAN_LEVELS_MINIMAL. Full-dataset round-trip proved **SPAN_LEVELS_FULL** —
4,162,560/4,162,560 chunks, 100%. MINIMAL scored 76%, matching only cells whose
last data square lands on a level boundary; the synthetic test cell passed it by
coincidence. Default corrected.

**FINDING — vegetation_trees_01 has no atlas sprite.** 24 texturepacks hold
46,540 names, NONE under `vegetation_trees_01`. Vegetation sheets present are
foliage/ornamental/indoor/farming/gardening/drying only. Tree tiles authored by
TreeScatter (`vegetation_trees_01_8/10/11`) are tiledefs-only names with no
pixels — the properties-but-no-pixels case SpriteNames exists to catch. In-game
trees rely on load-time species substitution (§11), not a direct atlas hit.
RENDERER IMPLICATION (C3): an authored tile is not guaranteed a sprite; the
renderer must flag or substitute. "Authored tile with no atlas sprite" is a
validation rule (A4/C5) — the smarter-than-a-paint-program check that is the
project's point (§1).

**Storage changes (invisible to the format).** LE reads over std::span, not an
owned byte[], so a cell can be mmap'ed and chunks decoded on demand. LotPack
Chunk stores only the levels it has (flat vectors + one contiguous tile pool)
instead of Java's MAX_LEVELS×8×8 pointer array per chunk.

**Environment gotcha.** Files authored off-machine can carry future timestamps;
Ninja then loops "manifest still dirty after 100 tries." Fix: `touch *.cpp *.hpp
CMakeLists.txt` after dropping in new files, then rebuild.

**Repo hygiene.** The build/ directory was committed by mistake (object files,
CMakeCache with absolute paths, test binaries). A .gitignore now excludes it;
remove it from tracking with `git rm -r --cached build`.

**Ported next (app-layer gate):** CellData, Square — where the format model
becomes an editable cell. Then C1 can be written against a real C++ stack.


Why the semantic layer is the whole competitive argument: `.tiles` property data
(`IsWall`, `IsDoor`, facing, container type, NorthWall/WestWall pairing) is what
makes an editor smarter than a paint program — auto wall-joining, room
detection, and validation rules like *doorway with no adjacent floor*, *room
with no exit*, *wall gap that isn't a door*. That is exactly where the official
tools are weakest, and where a new editor earns its place. TileZed lets you
paint an invalid map; this should not.

### The GIS pipeline is a side project, not the goal

`GisImport` / `GisCells` turn public-domain GIS data into a playable map mod.
It exists for two reasons:

- **A fast, honest exercise of the whole stack.** It authors cells from nothing
  — headers, tile tables, floors, walls, rooms, buildings, chunk grid, spawn
  points, biome maps — so every layer gets used end to end rather than
  unit-tested in isolation.
- **It is how the engine's mod contract was learned.** Almost everything now
  known about how B42 accepts an authored map (§5) was discovered by making a
  generated map load and then diagnosing why it didn't look right. An editor
  needs that contract regardless of who authors the tiles.

It is also a genuinely useful quick-start path — real town in, playable map out
— so it stays. But when the two tracks conflict, the editor wins, and GIS
features are only worth building when they teach something the editor needs.

---

## 2. Where things stand

### Editor track

Working today, verified:

- Read any vanilla or mod cell, modify it, write it back; the game accepts it.
- **Layer-aware editing** (`CellEditor`): `setFloor`, `setWall(edge, tile)`,
  `removeWall(edge)`, `addObject`, `clearObjects`, `clearSquare`, `fillFloor`,
  `outlineRoom`. Replacing a floor leaves walls, overlays and objects intact;
  removing a wall takes its door leaf or window pane with it.
- **Grouped undo/redo** that restores byte-identical output. A 36-square fill
  undoes in one step.
- Isometric rendering to PNG — correct projection, trimmed-sprite offsets,
  mixed 1×/2× atlases, z-stepping.
- Square-level semantic resolution: floor, north/west walls, doorways, windows,
  fixtures, containers, movement blocking, room membership.

The proof, on Muldraugh cell 42_40 — re-flooring a 6×6 living room:

```
before:      2 north walls, 12 west walls, 1 door, 1 window, 24 objects
after:       2 north walls, 12 west walls, 1 door, 1 window, 24 objects
destructive: 0              0              0        0         0
diff after undo: none
lotpack bytes identical to the original file: true
```

Not built yet: TMX/PZW interop, `.tiles` writers, auto wall-joining, validation
rules, any interactive UI, live rendering. Rendering is offline PNG only.

**One open thread flagged and never closed.** `outlineRoom` places north walls
at `y0+h` and west walls at `x0+w` — the far edges belonging to the *next*
square out. That follows from edge-based walls, but it is **reasoning, not
measurement**, and reasoning is what produced the x/y transposition and the
`attachedN` bug. The check is cheap: read a real Muldraugh room's actual wall
positions and compare against what `outlineRoom` generates for the same
rectangle. Do this before building anything on top of room creation.

**CLOSED 2026-08-10 — the offsets are correct. See §18.** The thread was
already stale when written: `Probe roomgeom` had made the measurement and
§10 recorded it.

### GIS track

The pipeline works end to end. A GIS area becomes 4 cells that load in game
with correct roads, buildings, ground and vegetation, and **no visible boundary
against the surrounding procedurally generated land**. The most recent win was
the biome map (§6), which is what made terrain continuous across the map edge —
the engine now generates vegetation on our cells from the same rules it uses
everywhere else.

Buildings are the weak point on both tracks: currently one bounding box per
footprint with derived perimeter walls. No roof, no interior subdivision, no
doors, no windows.

---

## 3. What is next, in order

1. **Verify `outlineRoom` against a real room.** Cheap, and everything about
   building generation and room authoring sits on it. Editor track.

2. **Cleanup with evidence already in hand.** `TreeScatter` / `TreePalette`
   place ~7,800 trees that `genMapSquare` deletes on load, and
   `WorldGenOverride.lua` is superseded by the biome map. Delete both,
   regenerate, and confirm in game that nothing changes — that *proves* they
   were dead weight rather than assuming it.

3. **Buildings.** The substantial piece. Read a vanilla house first
   (`Probe square` / `findprop` against Muldraugh) before writing anything.
   There is an open design fork:
   - a room-splitting generator that decomposes footprints into rectangles,
     places roofs, doors on street-facing walls, windows, interior doorways; or
   - `StaticModule.prefab`, the engine's own structure placement mechanism,
     **never tried, not yet read in the decompiler.**

   For the editor these are not equivalent. A room-splitting generator produces
   authored geometry the editor can then edit, validate and undo. `prefab`
   produces something the engine assembles at load time, which the editor cannot
   inspect the same way. **Read `StaticModule` in the decompiler before choosing** —
   the decision should not be made from the name alone.

4. **Room type names.** Generic `"room"` gives no loot tables. Meaningful types
   are needed for a generated map to be playable and for the editor to validate.

---

## 4. How to work on this project

This matters more than it usually would. **Eight real bugs got through 224
automated tests. All eight were caught by comparison against an independent
source, never by more testing of the same kind.**

- **Check what vanilla does before building anything.** Retail map data and the
  game's own Lua under `media/lua/server/WorldGen/` are readable and
  authoritative. Skipping this has cost three multi-session detours.
- **Prefer the recipe to the output.** Measuring Muldraugh describes one
  hand-authored town. Reading the generator's Lua describes the generator, works
  anywhere, and survives a game update.
- **Predict the number before running the command.** "squares should be
  3,145,728 and edge-filled 671,718" turns a run into a test.
- **Ask what would falsify a result.** A test that cannot fail proves nothing.
  An underdetermined linear system is trivially consistent.
- **Report rates over the population that can discriminate.** A 67.63% floor
  from trivially-empty files made noise look like signal for two sessions.
- **Sample spatial data contiguously.** A strided sample can alias. A 4-tile
  transect through a dithered ground boundary returned four identical
  materials in a row and was read as a region band; the contiguous row is
  `M D M D M M M D D`. Two ground transects were wrong this way (§26).
- **A sampling tool's cap is part of the measurement.** `Probe findprop` is
  hard-capped at 3 hits per cell by `PropsProbe.find`. Built into a rate, it
  produced a clean, plausible, entirely void result — "100% width 1", which
  happened to agree with the hypothesis under test. A 3-square sample cannot
  produce a run longer than 1. Check what a tool *can* return before believing
  what it did return (§27).
- **A test one layer above the bug cannot see it.** `MaskRule`'s self-test
  checked direction-set to tile-offset and passed 8/8 while N and W were
  transposed in the direction-to-neighbour table one layer below. `MaskAudit`
  could not see it either, because it reads vanilla rather than our output.
  The render caught it in one look. When a test passes, ask which layer it
  actually exercises (§29).
- **TIS's tile names are data, not our identifiers.** A blind textual rename of
  "overlay" to "tuft" ate the string literal `blends_grassoverlays_01_`,
  silently zeroing the tuft layer. The guard searched for the OLD spelling, so
  it could see under-renaming and was blind to over-renaming. Rename our
  identifiers; never their strings (§29).
- **Change one thing per test.**
- **The renderer is a hypothesis too.** It has been wrong twice. When the
  picture looks wrong, the picture may be what is wrong.
- **PZ is Java.** `unzip projectzomboid.jar`, Vineflower, and
  `grep -rl <symbol> --include='*.class'` beat inference from file bytes. Ten
  minutes with a decompiler has repeatedly answered what statistics could not.
- **Byte-identical round-tripping proves a format was read and written
  faithfully. It says nothing about whether it was *interpreted* correctly.**

Working style that has been productive: propose an approach, name the check that
would prove it wrong, run it, then write code.

**Patch delivery:** patches come as Python scripts that abort unless each anchor
matches exactly once. Fish has no heredocs, so multi-line edits need a file.
Files are handed over as downloads to `~/Downloads`, then copied into the repo.

---

## 5. Environment and machine layout

Garuda Linux, **fish shell**, Java 21 (toolchain targets 21; library is Java 17+
compatible), IntelliJ.

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| Git repo | `~/Documents/PZMapCreation` (source in `src/main/java/pzformat/`) |
| Scratch / probes | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF` |
| Extracted game jar | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/pzjar/` |
| Decompiled classes | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/` |
| Vineflower | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/vineflower.jar` (1.12.0, fat jar) |
| Game install (`$PZ`) | `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid` |
| Vanilla maps (`$MAPS`) | `$PZ/media/maps` — Muldraugh, KY is the 4065-cell reference |
| GIS inputs | `~/pzgis/` — `area.geojson`, `buildings.geojson`, `roads.geojson`, `fetch_gis.py` |
| Generated mod | `~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/` |
| Renders | `~/pzrender/` |
| Saves | `~/Zomboid/Saves/<mode>/<timestamp>/` |

```fish
set -U PZ   "/home/kaatlev/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid"
set -U MAPS "$PZ/media/maps"
```

If `$MAPS` expands empty, a *global* shadows the universal. Diagnose with
`set -S MAPS`; clear with repeated `set -e MAPS`, then re-`set -U`.

### Gotchas that have each cost real time

- **Run from the repo root.** `-cp out` is relative; from `~` it fails with
  `ClassNotFoundException` and nothing else.
- **`ls` is aliased to eza**, which rejects `-t` combined with a bare `-d`. Use
  `command ls` when a glob result matters. A wrong `ls` once hid 33 of 34 saves
  and derailed an investigation for several exchanges.
- **fish has no heredocs.** Multi-line scripts must go in a file.
- **Patch backups**: `.gitignore` carries `*bak`. Several `.treebak` /
  `.spawnbak` files got committed before that was broadened.

### Mod layout that works (copied from Maplewood)

```
~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/
├── 42/mod.info                         version metadata ONLY, versionMin=42.0
└── common/media/maps/PZGisImport/
    ├── map.info                        needs fixed2x=true; lots=Muldraugh, KY
    ├── <x>_<y>.lotheader
    ├── world_<x>_<y>.lotpack           NOTE the different naming convention
    ├── maps/biomemap_<x>_<y>.png       biome + zone, one pixel per tile
    ├── spawnpoints.lua
    ├── objects.lua                     currently {}; vanilla's is 4 MB
    └── WorldGenOverride.lua            superseded; remove
```

Two naming conventions in one directory, and a mismatch fails silently.

### The two GIS commands

Recovered from shell history three separate times on 2026-08-11 and
guessed wrong twice before that. They are not interchangeable: `gisimport`
writes a schematic PNG for eyeballing, `giscells` writes the actual mod.

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe gisimport \
    ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/roads.geojson ~/pzgis/area.geojson \
    ~/pzgis

java -cp out pzformat.Probe giscells \
    ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/roads.geojson ~/pzgis/area.geojson \
    "$PZ/media" ~/Zomboid/mods PZGisImport
```

Current dataset: 7 buildings (6 Residential, 1 Agriculture), 1 road,
495x424 tiles, generating 2x2 cells at 200_200..201_201.

---

## 6. What already exists — do not rebuild

### Java source, `src/main/java/pzformat/`

Refresh the real list with `find src -name '*.java' | sort` — this is the
inventory as of the last session.

**Format layer**: `LE`, `LEW`, `LotHeader`, `LotPack`, `LotPackAnalysis`,
`CellData`, `PackFile`, `PackAnalysis`, `TileDefs`, `TileBin`, `TileBinAnalysis`,
`TrailerAnalysis`, `Json`

**Semantics / rendering**: `TileIndex`, `Square`, `SpriteAtlas`, `SpriteJoin`,
`SpriteNames`, `CellRenderer`, `RoomGeometry`, `PropsProbe`

**Editing**: `CellEditor`, `EditDemo`, `MakeTestMod`, `Locate`, `SpawnMark`

**GIS pipeline**: `GisImport`, `GisCells`, `TilePalette`, `GroundPalette`,
`TreePalette`, `TreeScatter`, `BiomeMapWriter`

**WorldGen data**: `WorldGenFeatures`, `WorldGenBiomes`, `BiomePalette`

**Probes**: `Probe` (CLI), `SelfTest`, `Survey`, `RoundTrip`, `PaletteScan`,
`TreeSurvey`, `GroundSurvey`, `LegacyPackProbe`

Notable internals worth knowing before touching them:

- `LE.java` tracks read position and dumps hex on failure — every parse error
  names a byte offset. `LE.hexDump()` at that offset is the debugging loop.
- `CellData.fill` replaces a square's **entire** tile stack. That is correct for
  "clear" and wrong for everything else — it is why an early in-game test
  punched holes through houses. `CellEditor` exists because of this.
- `CellEditor` routes every mutation through `apply()`, so undo is uniform:
  an edit is the before/after state of the squares it touched.
- `GisCells.assertNoEmptySquares` reimplements the engine's chunk gate (§7)
  against the **reparsed** cell, not the in-memory one.

### Python on the machine

- `~/pzgis/fetch_gis.py` — the only permanent Python. Fetches buildings and
  roads for an area polygon. **Already fixed** to probe all nine TIGERweb layers
  and deduplicate on geometry (§11). Do not rewrite it from scratch.
- `~/Downloads/patch_*.py` — transient patch scripts, one per edit, safe to
  delete after applying.

### Probe commands

Standalone (run directly, not via `Probe`):

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PaletteScan <media> <prefix>` | Tiles under a prefix: sprite, kind, CustomName, Material, flags |
| `PaletteScan <media> --prop <key>` | Distinct values of a property across all tiles |
| `PaletteScan <media> --find <text>` | Tiles whose CustomName contains text |
| `TreeSurvey <media>` | `tree` size classes mapped to tilesets and species |
| `GroundSurvey <mapdir> <cell>...` | How vanilla composes ground squares |
| `WorldGenFeatures <media> [CAT]` | Parsed feature tile lists |
| `WorldGenBiomes <media> [biome]` | Parsed biome feature references with `p` |
| `BiomePalette <media> [biome] [n]` | Composed sample squares for a biome |
| `LegacyPackProbe <file \| dir>` | Walk legacy `.pack`, verify against PNG offsets |

Via `Probe`: `survey`, `mapdir`, `lotheader`, `lotpack`, `roundtrip`, `pack`,
`packinfo`, `sprites`, `props`, `square`, `findprop`, `gisimport`, `giscells`,
`render`, `editdemo`.

**The two that matter most for verification:**

```
square   <mediadir> <mapdir> <X_Y> <x> <y> <z>     dump every tile + properties
findprop <mediadir> <mapdir> <X_Y> <prop>          find squares having a property
```

Point them at `"$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"` to see what vanilla does, and at the
generated mod to see what we do. **Comparing the two is the single most
effective technique in this project.**

### The loop

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
python3 ~/Downloads/patch_x.py            # if patching
javac -d out (find src -name '*.java')
java -cp out pzformat.SelfTest 2>&1 | tail -3
rm -rf ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport
java -cp out pzformat.Probe giscells ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/roads.geojson ~/pzgis/area.geojson "$PZ/media" ~/Zomboid/mods PZGisImport
java -Xmx4g -cp out pzformat.Probe render ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport "$PZ/media/texturepacks" 200_200 80 157 64 0 0 ~/pzrender/x.png
```

The render is fast feedback but **only shows authored data**. Anything WorldGen
generates — trees, bushes, grass, ore — is invisible to it and must be checked
in game.

Refresh before starting:

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
find src -name '*.java' | sort
git log --oneline -15
```

---

## 7. Engine behaviour — CONFIRMED in the decompiler

### What gates generation

In `zombie/iso/worldgen/WorldGenChunk.generateChunks`:

```java
if (ch.hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()) {
    genRandomChunk(...);      // full procedural generation
} else {
    genMapChunk(...);         // treated as authored — still reads the biome map
    cleanChunk(ch, "Sand",   "vegetation_groundcover_01");
    cleanChunk(ch, "Road_*", "vegetation_groundcover_01");
}
```

`IsoChunk.hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()` returns true if **any** of a chunk's 64
squares has no object at z=0 or below. One gap flips the whole chunk to
procedural. The engine treats a `null` square as empty, so a mirror assertion
must check a square object **exists**, not merely that it is non-empty.

**`cleanChunk` is harmless to us — CONFIRMED.** It matches on the floor's
`FloorMaterial` property, not the sprite name, and removes only objects whose
sprite name starts with `vegetation_groundcover_01`:

```java
String floorMaterial = floor.getSprite().getProperties().get("FloorMaterial");
if (floorMaterial != null && floorMaterial.matches("^Road.*")) { ... }
```

Our grass carries `FloorMaterial = Grass_Dark`. Authored roads are never
touched. This closed the oldest open question in the project.

### Registration as an authored cell

`MapFiles.load()`: `*.lotheader` → `createLotHeader()`, the only thing that
expands bounds and registers into `infoHeaders`. `*.lotpack` → `infoFileNames`
only. `chunkdata_*` → no bounds effect, no `bgHasCell`.

`IsoMetaGrid.CreateStep1` merges `MapFiles` backwards with `putAll`, so for a
contested cell the *earlier* map directory wins. Scanning starts at
`Core.gameMap` and recurses through `getLotDirectories()`. Our `map.info` has
`lots=Muldraugh, KY`, so vanilla is scanned alongside us and bounds are the
union. **CONFIRMED working** — `console.txt` shows `PZGisImport` followed by the
Knox County chain.

### Geometry

Chunk = 8×8 tiles. Cell = 256×256 tiles = 32×32 chunks. **PZwiki's File Formats
page documents B41 and is wrong for B42** on magic bytes, string terminators,
cell size, offset width and chunk size.

### Coordinate systems — the bug that cost three sessions

`spawnpoints.lua` `worldX`/`worldY` are **legacy 300-tile cell coordinates**.
`posX`/`posY` are offsets within that 300-tile cell.

Emitting `worldX = 200` for cell 200_200 put the player at world tile
200 × 300 = 60000 while the cells occupy 51200..51711 — about 8,800 tiles east,
in pure procedural terrain. That looked exactly like "WorldGen destroyed my map"
and produced a recorded blocker that never existed.

```java
int worldTileX = cellX * 256 + localX;
worldX = worldTileX / 300;
posX   = worldTileX % 300;
```

**Diagnostic that found it:** the save's `map/` subdirectories are named by
chunk. They were 7530–7570 (world tile ~60240 ≈ 200.8 × 300) instead of the
expected 6400–6463. **When a map "does not load", read the chunk directory
numbers first.** They say where the player actually was.

The same 300-vs-256 legacy compatibility appears in `MapFiles.postLoad`, which
converts bounds with `minX * 256.0F / 300.0F`.

### Reading vanilla spawnpoints — the inverse conversion

§7 recorded the forward transform only, which is why finding a known-good
vanilla building has been done by eye. The inverse is the useful direction:
a spawnpoint is a coordinate someone at TIS chose deliberately, and vanilla
spawns are inside buildings.

```
$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY/spawnpoints.lua        plain Lua, readable
```

```java
int worldTileX = worldX * 300 + posX;      // legacy 300-tile cell -> world tile
int cellX      = worldTileX / 256;         // B42 256-tile cell
int localX     = worldTileX % 256;         // square within that cell
```

Same for Y. Feed `cellX_cellY` to `Probe lotheader` and `localX localY` to
`Probe square`. **UNVERIFIED**: that vanilla B42 keeps spawnpoints in this
file and this format at all. Confirm by reading it before relying on it; if
the shape differs, that fact belongs here.

## 8. The WorldGen data model

All plain Lua under `$PZ/media/lua/server/WorldGen/`, and all parseable —
`WorldGenFeatures` and `WorldGenBiomes` do it.

### Features — `features/<CATEGORY>/<n>.lua`

Categories: `BUSH`, `GROUND`, `NONE`, `ORE`, `PLANT`, `TREE`. 89 features across
90 files. Each is a list of tile names:

```lua
local medium_grass = {
    main = { "blends_natural_01_32", "blends_natural_01_37",
             "blends_natural_01_38", "blends_natural_01_39" },
}
worldgen.features.GROUND["medium_grass"] = medium_grass
```

**The nine GROUND features are exactly the four-tile groups** that a statistical
survey of Muldraugh independently found — a good cross-check of both:

| feature | tiles (`blends_natural_01_*` unless noted) |
|---|---|
| `sand` | 0, 5, 6, 7 |
| `dark_grass` | 16, 21, 22, 23 |
| `medium_grass` | 32, 37, 38, 39 |
| `light_grass` | 48, 53, 54, 55 |
| `dirt` | 64, 69, 70, 71 |
| `dirt_grass` | 80, 85, 86, 87 |
| `clay` | 96, **101**, 102, 103 |
| `water` | `blends_natural_02_0, 5, 6, 7` |
| `burnt` | `floors_burnt_01_8, 13, 14, 15` |

`blends_natural_01_101` is **clay** — which is why an early palette that picked
it produced brown ground.

### Biomes — two separate tables

- `biomes/worldgen/<n>.lua` → `worldgen.biomes[...]`. 76 entries (10 files plus
  ore-level variants using `parent`). **Have a GROUND feature.** These are what
  `WorldGenOverride.lua` selects.
- `biomes/map/<n>.lua` → `worldgen.biomes_map[...]`. **No GROUND feature** —
  they are applied to authored cells, where the floor already exists. These are
  what the biome map selects.
- `biomes/subbiomes/<n>.lua` → shared components (`grass`, `bushes`,
  `small_trees`, `no_tree`, …).

A biome entry:

```lua
features = {
    GROUND = { { f = worldgen.features.GROUND.medium_grass, p = 1.0 } },
    PLANT  = { { f = worldgen.features.PLANT.grass_medium,  p = 0.3 } },
    BUSH   = { { f = worldgen.features.BUSH.bush_regular,   p = 0.01 } },
    TREE   = { { f = worldgen.features.TREE.maple_jumbo_xxl, p = 0.00125 }, ... },
}
```

`params.placements` decides which **floor tiles** a feature category may sit on,
as globs with `!` exclusions:

```lua
placements = {
    GENERIC = { "blends_natural_01_*" },
    PLANT   = { "!blends_natural_01_0", "!_5", "!_6", "!_7",
                "!blends_natural_01_64", "!_69", "!_70", "!_71" },
}
```

That exclusion list is `sand` and `dirt`. It is why dirt tiles end up bare.

---

## 9. The biome map — how terrain is really assigned

**CONFIRMED** by decompiling `zombie.iso.worldgen.maps.BiomeMap`, `BiomeRaster`,
and `WorldGenChunk`.

`<map>/maps/biomemap_<cellX>_<cellY>.png`, 256×256, one pixel per tile.

```java
private static final int NUM_BANDS = 2;
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    this.pixels[x * 2 + i + y * span] = (byte) pixel[i];
```

**RED = biome band, GREEN = zone band, BLUE ignored.** `BiomeMap.Type` is
`BIOME(0)`, `ZONE(1)` — a band selector, not a flag. Both bands index the same
`biome_map_config` table in `media/lua/server/metazones/BiomeMapConfig.lua`, via
`getBiomeName(index)` and `getZoneName(index)`.

That explains vanilla's colour families: `(153,153,153)` is one entry used for
both bands; `(254,141,254)` is biome 254 `dirt` inside zone 141 `FarmLand`;
`(179,64,64)` is biome 179 `pr_forest` inside zone 64 `ForagingNav`.

`getRaster` searches every map in `IsoWorld.getMap()` (semicolon separated) and
takes the first file that exists. **A missing file logs a debug line and returns
null** — safe and incremental.

Config values worth knowing: 0 Water, 64 ForagingNav, 96 `$random`/DeepForest,
115 `townhouse`/TownZone, 128 `farmmix_forest`/Farm, 141 …/FarmLand,
153 `ph_forest`/PHForest, 179 `pr_forest`/PRForest, 204 `farm_forest`/FarmForest,
217 `birch_forest`/BirchForest, 243 `organic_forest`/OrganicForest,
254 `dirt`/ForagingNav, 255 `primary_forest`/DeepForest.

### What it drives — and what it takes away from us

`genMapChunk` runs on **authored** chunks and reads the biome map:

```java
int[] biomes = map.getZones(ch.wx, ch.wy, Type.BIOME);
BiomeMapEntry lookup = map.getEntry(biomes[tileY * 8 + tileX]);
```

Then per tile, for each of TREE, BUSH, PLANT:

```java
if (!canPlace(biome.placements().get(type), floorName))
    square.DeleteTileObject(currentTiles.get(type));      // wrong floor -> delete
else
    retval = applyBiome(biome, type, ...);                // else replace with biome's own
// on SUCCESS, delete every other tree/bush/grass-like object on the square
```

So:

- **We author**: floors, roads, walls, buildings, rooms. The engine does not
  replace floors — map biomes have no GROUND feature.
- **The engine owns**: trees, bushes, grass — deleted and replaced per tile from
  the biome map.

**OBSERVED in game:** with biome maps written, walking outward from the road
passes through the authored gradient (town → farm_forest → ph_forest →
primary_forest), with correct species, boulders from ORE features, and **no seam
at the cell boundary**. The biome map takes precedence over
`WorldGenOverride.lua` on authored chunks.

`replaceSquare` is narrower: only `biome.getReplacements()`, mapping specific
sprite names to alternatives. Not a wholesale floor swap.

**Consequence for ground choice:** because `placements` excludes `sand` and
`dirt` from PLANT and BUSH, any dirt tile we author ends up **bare**, with
surrounding grass tufts stripped off it. Scattering dirt at 14% (a figure
measured from hand-authored Muldraugh) produced exactly that: bare diamonds
through otherwise mixed forest, stopping dead at the cell boundary.
`GroundPalette` now uses grass groups only; dirt is retained as named constants
for deliberate use — tracks, yards, unpaved roads.

## 10. Format layer — CONFIRMED

| Format | Verification |
|---|---|
| `.lotheader` | 4065 / 4065 cells; byte-identical |
| `.lotpack` | 4065 / 4065 cells, 4,162,560 chunks; byte-identical |
| `.pack` | **24 / 24 retail atlases**, both layouts; byte-identical |
| `.tiles` binary | 73,644 tiles; all 37,060 with a text sibling match 100% |
| `.tiles` text | 61,418 tiles from 7 files, 616 tilesets |
| `biomemap_X_Y.png` | Format read in the engine; writer produces loadable maps |
| Room geometry | Wall offsets across 86 rooms, both far sides confirmed |

### `.lotheader`

```
char[4]  "LOTH"
int32    version          1
int32    tileCount
         tileName '\n'    x tileCount
int32    levelsAbove      8 in all 4065 cells
int32    levelsBelow      8
int32    minLevel         actual z of chunk index 0; negative for basements
int32    maxLevel
int32    roomCount
  room:  name '\n'; int32 floor; int32 rectCount; int32 x,y,w,h x rectCount;
         int32 objectCount; int32 a,b,c x objectCount
int32    buildingCount
  building: int32 roomCount; int32 roomIndex x roomCount
byte[1024]  32x32 per-chunk grid, values 0..10
```

90,827 rooms and 90,827 room references — every room belongs to exactly one
building. **Wall convention: south wall belongs to the next square down, east
wall to the next square right.**

### `.pack` — both layouts

The entry table is identical in both, **and so is the per-page `int32` after
`numEntries`**. Believing that field was PZPK-only was the entire bug: the
reader skipped it, read its value as the first entry's name length, and derailed
on byte one.

```
[optional] char[4]   "PZPK"
[optional] int32     version
int32                numPages
page * numPages:
    lenString        pageName
    int32            numEntries
    int32            unknown            1 almost always, but 0 on three pages of
                                        UI.pack — NOT a version constant
    entry * numEntries:
        lenString    entryName
        int32 x, y, w, h, ox, oy, fx, fy
    [PZPK]   int32   pngByteLength
    byte[]           pngBytes
    [legacy] int32   0xDEADBEEF         page separator
```

Legacy PNGs have **no length prefix** — walk chunk headers to IEND. Validation
that can fail: after walking `numEntries` entries the offset must land
**exactly** on a PNG magic. All 20 pages across the 11 legacy files did.

`0xDEADBEEF` absence after the final page is **UNVERIFIED** — an IEND walk
landing on EOF is indistinguishable from one landing 4 bytes short then
consuming a separator. `pageSeparator` is recorded per page, not derived.

### Sprite scale is a property of the pack, not the sprite

`scale = packName.contains("2x") ? 0.5 : 1.0`. The old `fx >= 128 ? 0.5 : 1.0`
heuristic held only while the pack list was `Tiles1x` (64px) and `Tiles2x`
(128px); jumbo tree art is 1× at 192×256 and got shrunk to ground-level blobs.

**`SpriteAtlas.MAP_PACKS` is a hardcoded list.** A pack absent from it is
invisible to the renderer regardless of whether `PackFile` can parse it.

Still open in the format layer: the 3-int32 room object records; `.tiles`
writers; TMX interop; `objects.lua` / `roomtones.lua` / `streets.xml` parsing.

### `chunkdata_X_Y.bin` — closed as a question, not a format

Zombie population data. **No influence on WorldGen.** `natives/libPZPopMan64.so`
exports `..._n_1saveCell`, `..._n_1loadChunk`, `..._n_1addZombie`;
`LoadGameScreen.lua:231` offers a debug item `DeleteChunkDataXYBin`;
`MapFiles.load()` registers it with no bounds or `bgHasCell` effect. Four probe
generations killed every structural hypothesis. If ever needed, **decompile
`zombie.popman.*`** rather than probing bytes again.

Trap that wasted two sessions: 2749 of 4065 files have N=0, so naive success
rates carry a **67.63% floor that means nothing**. Report over N>0 files. Second
trap: "fits `2 + 1024 + N*64`" is arithmetically identical to "fits `2 + M*64`",
since 1024 = 16×64.

---

## 11. Tiles, sprites, trees

**Tile definitions and sprite atlases are independent sets.** 61,418 tiles carry
properties; 46,540 sprite names exist. A tile can pass every property filter and
have no pixels — it writes correctly, round-trips byte-identically, satisfies
`hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()`, and renders as a checkerboard. No existing test
catches that. `SpriteNames.load()` builds the sprite set; `TilePalette` requires
membership.

### Authored data cannot choose tree species — CONFIRMED

Vanilla Muldraugh 35_35 authors exactly `vegetation_trees_01_8` … `_11`. No
species tile appears in any vanilla lotheader. Those generic tiles carry `tree`,
`solid`, `attachedFloor`, `BlocksPlacement`, `vegitation` — and **have no sprite
in any atlas**. The engine substitutes species and mature size at runtime.

The `e_redmapleJUMBO_1` / `e_virginiapineJUMBOXXL_1` sheets (11 species × 8 size
classes) are **render-time art**. Authoring them produces canopies lying on the
grass, because a 192×256 full frame is 1× art that overhangs its square, not 2×
art to be halved.

Given §9, authoring trees at all is pointless — `genMapSquare` deletes them.

### Useful discriminating properties

| Need | Discriminator |
|---|---|
| Grass vs dirt | `grassFloor` bare flag |
| Standalone ground vs edge blend | `solidfloor` present, `FloorOverlay` absent |
| House interior floor | `Material = Wood`; `Brick` is bathroom/kitchen tiling |
| Trunk vs ground cover | `solid` on the `vegetation_trees_01` sheet |

`CustomName` exists on interior floors but is **absent on all natural ground and
tree tiles**, so it cannot be the general selector.

Wall encoding: `wall` is a bare flag with no orientation. An earlier version
keyed off `attachedN`/`attachedW` and validated at 99.5% against room geometry
**while being wrong** — decoration hangs on walls, so it occupies the same
squares. A correlated proxy can pass a test for the wrong reason.

---

## 12. The GIS pipeline

**Step 1 — draw the area** at <https://geojson.io>, save to `~/pzgis/area.geojson`.
One 256×256 cell ≈ **0.0023° lat × 0.0029° lon** around 38°N.

**Step 2 — fetch:** `python3 ~/pzgis/fetch_gis.py ~/pzgis/area.geojson ~/pzgis`

- **Buildings** — USA Structures (FEMA / Oak Ridge / USGS). Public domain.
  Carries `OCC_CLS` / `PRIM_OCC`. Only structures over 450 sq ft; machine
  extracted, so footprints can be a metre or two off.
- **Roads** — Census TIGER/Line. Public domain.

⚠️ **TIGERweb splits roads across layers 0–8** by class and scale. The original
script queried layer 2 only and silently returned zero features for anything
else — indistinguishable from "there is no road here". Pondlick Rd is in
**layer 7**, registered as `Co Hwy 26`. `fetch_gis.py` now probes all nine and
merges, deduplicating **on geometry, not `LINEARID`** (a road crossing the box
in two segments shares an ID).

**Step 3 — always pass `area.geojson`.** Feature services return whole features
intersecting the bbox, so one road can run for kilometres beyond your area.

**Step 4 — preview** with `gisimport`; a typical house should be **10–15 tiles
across**.

**Step 5 — `giscells`.** Cells are placed at origin **200_200**, clear of Knox
County.

Licensing is still open: verify GIS dataset terms per state and choose a licence
before publishing. Separately, **never redistribute extracted PZ tilesheets or
art** — read from the user's install. Format reverse-engineering is well
tolerated in this community; shipping TIS's assets is not.

Last generation run:

```
7 buildings (1530 tiles), 1 road (2808 tiles), extent 495 x 424
ground palette: 3 base groups, 54 overlays
cells written: 4   squares: 262144   rooms: 8   edge-filled: 52264

## 13. Corrections — beliefs that turned out wrong

Acting on any of these wastes real time.

| Old claim | Status |
|---|---|
| "WorldGen paves over authored terrain" is the project blocker | **FALSE.** Never existed. It was the spawn coordinate bug (§7). |
| `spawnpoints.lua` uses B42 256-tile cells | **FALSE.** Legacy **300-tile** grid. |
| The 11 unparsed `.pack` atlases are cosmetic UI art | **FALSE.** Two are the tree atlases. All 24 now parse. |
| Interior floor renders as a missing-texture checkerboard | **FALSE.** It was `"Grey Diagonal Tiles"`, rendering correctly. |
| Map data can specify tree species and mature size | **FALSE.** Generic tiles only; the engine substitutes (§11). |
| Authoring vegetation into the lotpack works | **FALSE.** `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces TREE/BUSH/PLANT per tile (§9). |
| Ground should imitate Muldraugh's measured tile mix | **FALSE.** Muldraugh is hand-authored. Drive from biome definitions (§8, §9). |
| GIS footprints can be rasterized at their real-world bearing | **FALSE.** Room rects are `x, y, w, h` with no rotation field; walls are N/W edges only. Off-axis footprints stair-step and their rooms do not register cleanly (§17). |
| Vanilla `spawnpoints.lua` uses `worldX`/`worldY` plus 300-tile offsets | **FALSE for B42 retail.** Muldraugh's file has `posX`/`posY`/`posZ` only, as absolute world tiles. Our write path uses the legacy form and works, so the reader evidently accepts both (§18). |
| A cell's per-square room id identifies the room | **FALSE.** `-1` on every interior square sampled. Membership comes from lotheader rects only (§18). |
| The trees visible on the generated map are the engine's | **UNPROVEN, and evidence points the other way.** WorldGen skips chunks with no empty squares, and GisCells fills every square; our tree tiles are present in the lotpack. A2 step 1 is blocked until settled (§25). |
| A ground square is one base tile plus at most one overlay | **FALSE.** Vanilla stacks several base tiles per square at region boundaries — one square in 42_40 carries five. That stacking IS the blend mechanism (§24). The verdict stands but **the reason stated here is itself wrong**: a square carries exactly one solid tile. The others are mask tiles with `FloorOverlay` (§26). |
| Ground region choice tracks distance from habitation | **UNSUPPORTED.** Suggested by a town-vs-forest comparison, then not borne out by a fine transect. Region driver is still unknown (§24). **Still unsupported, but the fine transect no longer counts against it** — it was an aliasing artifact (§26). Nothing supports it either. For authored cells the driver is a human painting land use; for us it is GIS land use. |
| Terrain continuity was the remaining boundary problem | **INCOMPLETE.** The biome map made terrain continuous; POPULATION was never addressed. Zombies spawn on vanilla ground and stop dead at our boundary (§22). |
| Ground groups can be selected per square from their measured frequencies | **FALSE.** The 70/21/10 split across Muldraugh is a split BETWEEN regions, not within them. Vanilla shows 16/16 identical `Grass_Dark` in a row; ours changes three times in eight squares (§21). |
| Dropping the dirt groups was the fix for scattered bare diamonds | **SYMPTOM ONLY.** The cause is the missing region layer. Dirt is correct ground for tracks and yards and should return once regions exist (§21). |
| Off-axis rooms exist in vanilla Muldraugh | **UNSUPPORTED — printed by a broken guard, twice.** Both times the alignment test was measuring interior partitions, not skew. Current best answer: no off-axis room found (§19). |
| `alignment()` is a working prototype of A4's "expressible as a rect" rule | **OVERSTATED.** It took four attempts to stop false-positiving on vanilla, and it cannot test 80.3% of rects (§19). |
| Cell 200_200 can test `outlineRoom` | **FALSE.** GIS buildings do not go through `outlineRoom`, and their bbox rects do not match their diagonal wall runs. The measurement is void, not negative (§18). |
| Multi-user editing is a reason to prefer a Spring Boot + WebGL UI | **SUPERSEDED.** CHARTER §3, 2026-08-08: no multi-user concurrent editing. The UI fork stays open on other grounds. |
| A `Grass_Medium` band sits at x=112–124 in 42_40 inside `Grass_Dark`, with Dark on both sides | **FALSE — sampling artifact.** A 4-tile stride aliased a dithered boundary. There is no band (§26). |
| Filtering ground samples on `FloorMaterial` measures regions | **FALSE.** Mask tiles carry `FloorMaterial` too. Filter on `solidfloor`. This flaw is behind three of the four ground transects and behind §21's unexplained "25 `FloorMaterial` lines from 16 probes" (§26). |
| The biome map is what removed the map-edge seam | **INCOMPLETE.** `Blending.changeGround` feathers solid tiles 0–3 squares in from any edge shared with a procedural chunk. A second mechanism is doing visible work there (§26). |
| `GroundSurvey`'s "never more than one overlay, 0 of 257,703" describes ground stacking | **MEASURED THE TUFT LAYER ONLY.** True of `blends_grassoverlays_01`; it never counted mask tiles, which live on the base sheet (§26). |
| The engine will blend our authored ground at load | **FALSE.** `Blending.applyBlending` fires only where a chunk borders a **procedural** chunk, and it replaces solid tiles rather than writing masks. Every mask must be authored (§26). |
| `Clay` is the highest-priority natural material | **FALSE.** Asserted in-session from a 3-cell sample where `Clay > Grass_Dark` appeared at n=3. The full 4,065-cell corpus shows `Dirt > Clay` (1,119) and `Dirt_Grass > Clay` (1,038): **Clay is the lowest.** The n=3 reading sat inside the noise floor (§27). |
| Mask priority is a total order | **INCOMPLETE.** Every pair in the corpus shows both directions. Natural ground behaves as a rule with a 1-in-3,000 noise floor; similar road types do not separate cleanly, down to 2.5:1 (§27). |
| `FloorOverlay` identifies a blend mask | **INSUFFICIENT.** `street_curbs_01`, `overlay_grime_floor_01`, `industry_01` and `location_trailer_02` carry `FloorOverlay` with **no** `FloorMaterial` — they are decals. The discriminator needs `FloorOverlay` **and** `FloorMaterial` **and** a `FloorAttachment*` flag (§27). |
| Dither may be a 42_40 hand-painting quirk | **RESOLVED — it is general.** Mean single-square-island share 19.97% across all 4,065 Muldraugh cells. No curved or diagonal edge can produce a single-square component (§27). |
| The 16-tile mask block contract is uniform | **TRUE for natural ground only.** `blends_street_01` uses **8** masks per block, one variant set, not two. `Clay` uses 28 (§27). |
| Indices 112–127 of `blends_natural_01` are an unidentified side-mask set | **They carry `FloorMaterial Clay`.** Why clay has 28 mask indices where every other natural material has 12 is still UNVERIFIED (§27). |
| `Probe findprop` can measure a distribution | **FALSE.** Hard-capped at 3 hits per cell. It finds an example; it is never a census (§27). |
| The livingroom and kitchen are separated by a wall | **FALSE, and the reverse of a modern intuition.** 55.4% of vanilla livingroom/kitchen boundaries are FULLY OPEN, 33.0% partly, only **8.2% fully walled**. They are usually one continuous space (§35). |
| Always cutting the longer side keeps rooms well-proportioned | **FALSE for unbalanced splits.** A 2-square closet against a 42-square livingroom cuts nowhere near the middle, so on a wide region the cut pins at the minimum and yields a sliver running the full depth. Worst aspect was 7.0, and a 2×7 closet is 14 squares against vanilla's median of 2 — **the aspect defect and the size defect are the same defect** (§35). |
| A room's median size is a usable minimum | **FALSE.** Medians and minima differ by 2–3×: livingroom median 32 against a p5 of 16, bedroom 14 against 9, kitchen 21 against 9. The generator needs the p5, because the rule is "required rooms at their minimums, then bedrooms until the space runs out" (§35). |
| `RoomLayout` found only 10.5% of vanilla buildings recursively splittable, so the layout is not a BSP | **FALSE — the instrument was wrong.** It split on **bounding boxes**, and a room's box is not its shape: an L-shaped livingroom's box swallows whatever sits in its notch, so boxes overlap where the rooms do not. Splitting on **rects** gives **85.0%**, and 2-room buildings go from 66.1% to **100.0%** — which is the check that should have been run first, since two rooms failing to separate is near-impossible (§34). |
| Room count does not decide whether a building has a hallway | **FALSE.** It decides it almost by itself: 6.1% of 2–3 room buildings have one, 14.4% at 4–5, **57.3% at 6–7**, 84.9% at 8–10, 90% above. A clean sigmoid with the transition at 6–7 rooms. Asserted twice in-session that access rather than size was the factor; access is the *reason*, room count is what predicts it (§33). |
| The GIS footprint should decide what each building becomes | **SUPERSEDED by an owner decision, 2026-08-14.** GIS is authoritative for what EXISTS; gameplay is additive. Every real footprint stays a real building of its real class, and where the game needs something the data lacks it is **added** and attached to a host — never reclassified. Reclassification would destroy the provenance distinction permanently and invisibly (§33). |
| One PZ tile is one metre (assumed since the first import) | **CONFIRMED to 0.4%**, and only now. Total building tiles 1,409 against the dataset's own `SQMETERS` sum of 1,403 across seven footprints. The whole coordinate path rested on this and nothing had ever checked it (§32). |
| `GisImport.project` is a harmless coordinate conversion | **FALSE — it was quantising before measurement.** Rounding every vertex to an integer tile cost 2–7% of every footprint's area, always downward: all seven measured below their recorded `SQMETERS`. The loss is unrecoverable afterwards, because `FootprintSnap` never saw the precision (§32). |
| The jagged buildings were a room-rect problem | **FALSE, twice over.** `RoomShapes` on our own map: 8 rooms, 8 rects, fill ratio **1.000**, zero staircases — the room rects were already perfect rectangles. Nor was it a `deriveWalls` problem. The **raster** was: `fillPolygon` wrote the real 37–80° outline into `Cover.BUILDING`, and `deriveWalls` traced that while the room rect was computed separately as a bounding box (§31). |
| Buildings are rasterised as polygons, which snaps them to the grid for free (`GisImport` javadoc) | **FALSE.** Rasterising a polygon snaps its *tiles* to the grid; it does not make its *edges* axis-parallel, and the format needs the latter. The javadoc asserted the opposite of what the code needed to do for eleven days (§31). |
| §17: rotate the whole scene by the dominant footprint angle before rasterizing | **PREMISE FAILS on rural data, and is unnecessary anyway.** `FootprintAngles` over the current import: 7 footprints at 37, 61, 65, 71, 76, 80°, best ±3° window holding **33.3%** of area against §17's predicted "well over half". Scattered farmsteads each face their own driveway; there is no street grid because there is no street. And the target angle never needed discovering — see §30. |
| `RoomShapes` found 1,334 diagonal runs in vanilla, so §17's check 1 is answered | **FALSE — those are false positives and check 1 is still OPEN.** The detector fired on any two thin rects offset by 1 on both axes, which is every L-shaped closet: `[186,185 3x1]` then `[185,186 4x1]` is axis-aligned with a jog, not a diagonal. A real staircase is a **run** of rects each stepping consistently in the same direction, not a pair (§30). **Now ANSWERED with the corrected detector: 107 runs, 0.12%, and all 107 are widening rooms rather than staircases. The constraint is HARD (§30).** |
| Every block in a sheet has four solid variants | **FALSE for roads.** `blends_natural_01` does, all seven blocks. In `blends_street_01`, `Road_01` and `Road_02` have only **two** — B+6 and B+7 are spriteless. Solids must be listed per material, not computed (§29). |
| A passing self-test means the mask rule is implemented correctly | **INSUFFICIENT.** `MaskRule`'s self-test passed 8/8 with N and W transposed, because it never exercises the neighbour lookup. Point `MaskAudit` at our own output instead — it reads the map we wrote and checks masks against our neighbours (§29). |
| The generated road is too wide | **FALSE — it is 7 squares, exactly what `roadWidth("S1400") = 3` specifies.** Asserted three times from renders and refuted by one column count. The isometric projection makes a diagonal strip read far wider than it is (§29). |
| The GIS import carries land use (§22, §27) | **HALF TRUE, and the half that is false blocked E8.** `GisImport.Cover` is `{NONE, ROAD, BUILDING}`. Building footprints, road centrelines and a per-building occupancy class — no landcover. There is no evidence for multiple grass regions in open country, so E8 writes one (§28). |
| Dither is a coherent noise field | **FALSE.** Matched-distance lift is 0.95–1.14 on the boundary contour across every material pair and filter window, on 8,000+ pairs. Adjacent squares are independent. The 5–10× lift further out is a different population — genuine small regions the majority filter smoothed away (§28). |
| Vanilla's measured P(minority\|d) can be used directly as a flip probability | **FALSE.** They are different quantities: the measurement is the outcome after both sides of an edge have dithered. Using 0.27 as an input rate over-produced isolated squares 4×. The shipped profile is FITTED, not derived (§28). |

Known-stale, not yet cleaned up: `TreeScatter` / `TreePalette` still place
~7,800 trees the engine deletes; `WorldGenOverride.lua` is still written and is
superseded by the biome map.

**Do not re-derive this from a grep.** `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette` have
live callers in `GisCells` and `BiomeMapWriter`, and `treeAt` is genuinely
read and written into the square stack. That does **not** contradict the
line above: "superseded" here means the engine discards the output on load
(§9), not that the code is unreachable. A session on 2026-08-10 ran that
grep, found the callers, and wrongly concluded A2's premise was false. See
§20 for what the callers actually mean for the deletion.

## 15. Todo

### Immediate — evidence already in hand

- [x] Verify `outlineRoom` far-side wall placement against a real Muldraugh room
      — **done 2026-08-10, offsets correct (§18). A3, A4, A5 unblocked.**
- [ ] Delete `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette`; the engine deletes their output
      — **not wholesale: `BiomeMapWriter` needs `distanceToStructure` (§20)**
      — **BLOCKED. Do not start. Tree ownership is unresolved (§25).**
- [ ] **Settle tree ownership.** Walk a line of known authored tree
      positions in game and see whether trees stand at exactly those
      coordinates. Unblocks or kills A2 step 1 (§25)
- [x] Stop writing `WorldGenOverride.lua`; the biome map supersedes it
      — **CONFIRMED 2026-08-11 in game: removed, no seam, foliage clean.**
      Remove the write at `GisCells:220` and `writeWorldGenOverride` (§21)
- [ ] **Ground region layer.** Group selection must be spatial, not per
      square. Grass_Dark / Medium / Light are region distinctions, not
      texture (§21)
- [ ] Check whether the biome map already supplies the region signal before
      building a noise field (§21)
- [ ] Restore the dirt groups once regions exist; gate them to tracks and
      yards rather than open country (§21)
- [ ] Explain 25 output lines from 16 ground probes — some vanilla squares
      carry two ground tiles, which the survey's "never more than one
      overlay" result does not obviously allow (§21)
- [ ] Open question surfaced by A2: do authored tree tiles and engine biome
      vegetation target the same squares? (§20)
- [ ] Regenerate and confirm in game that nothing changes — that proves they
      were dead weight rather than assuming it

### Buildings — the next substantial piece

Current output is one bounding box per footprint with derived perimeter walls.
**Read a vanilla house first** (`Probe square` / `findprop` against Muldraugh)
before writing anything.

- [ ] Read `StaticModule.prefab` in the decompiler; decide the fork on evidence
- [ ] Count Muldraugh rooms with `rectCount > 1` forming a diagonal run — is
      the orientation constraint hard or merely dominant? (§17)
- [ ] Scan wall tiles for their declared orientation values (§17)
- [ ] `FootprintSnap` — one module, called by GIS import and by the editor
- [ ] Decompose footprints into multiple room rectangles
- [ ] Roofs; exterior doors on street-facing walls; windows
- [ ] Interior subdivision and doorways
- [ ] Meaningful room *type* names — generic `"room"` gives no loot tables
- [ ] Vary wall and floor materials by occupancy class

### Editor — the actual goal

- [ ] Auto wall-joining: pick the right variant from neighbours (corner, end,
      junction). All the information needed is already present.
- [ ] Validation rules: doorway with no adjacent floor, room with no exit, wall
      gap that isn't a door. **This is where the editor earns its place.**
- [ ] TMX read/write for interop with the official tools
- [ ] `.tiles` writers
- [ ] Interactive rendering — pan, zoom, live edit. Lower risk now that the PNG
      renderer proved the geometry. Knox County is ~1,300 cells and B42 added
      negative z-levels, so this needs sprite batching, an atlas cache and
      viewport streaming from day one; a naive per-tile draw dies immediately.
- [ ] **UI architecture is undecided.** Options discussed but never chosen:
      Spring Boot backend + WebGL canvas (gets multi-user editing, the one thing
      WorldEd can't do; costs atlas transfer bandwidth), or native LWJGL/libGDX.
      **The multi-user clause above is superseded** — CHARTER §3 ruled out
      concurrent editing on 2026-08-08 (see §13). The fork itself is still
      open; only that argument for the Spring Boot side is dead.
      A real working store (SQLite or chunked binary) rather than thousands of
      TMX files, with TMX/PZW kept purely as an interop boundary.

### Biome map quality

- [ ] Drive the **floor** from the same biomemap pixel, via `biomes_map`
      `placements`, so ground and vegetation come from one source
- [ ] Use `OCC_CLS` / `PRIM_OCC` to choose biome per parcel (Agriculture → Farm)
      rather than distance bands alone
- [ ] Dither or band the biome transition rather than hard distance thresholds
- [ ] Consider the ZONE band properly — it drives foraging

### Other

- [ ] Scene rotation pass in GIS import: dominant-grid histogram, then rotate
      buildings, roads and area polygon together before rasterizing (§17)
- [x] `roomgeom` guards: refuse to conclude when the two offsets are within
      a few points, and when wall runs are not axis-aligned (§18)
      — **margin guard done and working. Alignment guard took four attempts
      and still has 53 known false positives; one-token fix pending (§19).**
- [ ] **A3 prerequisite:** `TileIndex.edgeOf` falls back to
      `attachedN`/`attachedW` for tiles with no `Wall*` flag — the exact
      proxy its own comment warns against. Unreachable from `wallOn`, but
      `edgeOf` is public and A3 will call it on neighbours. Split it into a
      separate `decorationEdge()` or return NONE (§19)
- [ ] **A3 prerequisite:** confirm the tileset variant cycle. In
      `walls_exterior_house_01` the pattern is `WallW, WallN, WallNW,
      WallSE` every 4, openings every 16. Wall-joining needs that structure;
      per-tile flags alone do not say corner-vs-end-vs-junction (§19)
- [x] Apply the `&&` fix to `alignment()` and rerun the sweep (§19)
      — **done 2026-08-11. 53 false positives to 0; §17 check 1 closed.**
- [ ] Fix the stale class comment on `LotHeader` — it says the B42 trailer is
      left unparsed; `readB42Meta` parses all of it (§18)
- [x] Test whether `chunkGrid` is zombie density: mean over a town cell vs a
      forest cell should differ sharply (§18)
      — **CONFIRMED 2026-08-11 by three independent lines (§22).**
- [x] **Write zombie density into `chunkGrid`.** Currently all zeros, which
      is why our cells have no zombies. Must follow land use, not the
      vanilla histogram (§22)
      — **done 2026-08-11, confirmed in game (§23). Mechanism proven;
      calibration untested.**
- [ ] Calibrate density values. 2 near buildings is at the low end of
      vanilla's range and one hamlet is not a town (§23)
- [ ] Should density vary by occupancy class? The import distinguishes
      Agriculture from Residential and currently treats them alike (§23)
- [ ] Measure how vanilla's nonzero density correlates with what a place
      is — the recipe, not the histogram (§4, §23)
- [ ] Read the biome map's town/edge/forest/deep classification as the
      region signal for ground groups (§21, §23)
      — **do not start here. The region driver is not known to be distance
      from habitation (§24).**
- [ ] **Ground blending investigation.** How does vanilla stack ground
      tiles, and what decides which pairs blend? Prefer the recipe:
      `blends_natural_01` naming and properties, and the engine code that
      assembles ground squares at load. Measuring more of Muldraugh has
      now produced three complicated hypotheses in one session (§24)
- [ ] Identify what `Sand` represents mid-cell in 42_40 — parking, yard,
      or shore. If land use rather than distance, the region design
      changes again (§24)
- [ ] Extract `BiomeMapWriter`'s distance banding into a reusable method.
      Worth doing regardless: three consumers want a region signal (§24)
- [ ] Room rects must cover interior squares only — a bbox over a
      non-rectangular footprint marks outdoor squares as room members (§18)
- [ ] Road auto-tiling — corner, T-junction, end, edge by neighbour bitmask
- [ ] Populate `objects.lua` (currently `{}`; vanilla's is 4 MB) — likely
      related to room loot tables and worth checking alongside room type names
- [ ] `worldmap.xml` — `mapdir` reports it missing; imported areas do not appear
      on the in-game map without it
- [ ] Fast round-trip regression (currently ~14 min)
- [ ] Publish B42 format documentation (PZwiki is B41 and wrong)
- [ ] Verify GIS dataset licensing per-state; choose a licence

---

## 16. Independent sources available for checking

These are the things that have caught every real bug. Use them before writing
code, not after.

- **Retail map data** — `"$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"`, 4065 cells, via `Probe square`
  and `Probe findprop`.
- **The game's own Lua** — `$PZ/media/lua/server/WorldGen/` and
  `$PZ/media/lua/server/metazones/BiomeMapConfig.lua`. Plain text.
- **The decompiled engine** — `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/`, Vineflower
  at `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/vineflower.jar`.
  `grep -rl <symbol> --include='*.class'` finds the class first.
- **Artefacts the engine writes** — save `map/` chunk directory numbers, and
  `console.txt` for map registration order.
- **`Unjammer/PZ_Vanilla_map_b42`** — the whole vanilla map decompiled to a
  WorldEd project. A free regression corpus for TMX work when that starts.
- **PZ Reverse Mapper** (Nexus mod 337) — reads `.lotheader` and `.lotpack`,
  handles both 300 and 256 cells, rebuilds biomemaps. A second independent
  opinion on any cell.

### The eight bugs, and what caught each

1. **x/y transposition** — 4065 cells round-tripped byte-identical while every
   coordinate was mirrored. Caught by checking room rectangles against the tiles
   beneath them.
2. **`.pack` "verified"** — checked only against fixtures this project
   generated, which proves the reader agrees with the writer and nothing else.
3. **Wall encoding** — keying off `attachedN`/`attachedW` validated at 99.5%
   while being wrong. Decoration hangs on walls.
4. **chunkdata** — thousands of hypothesis tests on zombie population data.
5. **Spawn coordinates** — three sessions of in-game tests all measured a
   location 8,800 tiles from the map. Caught by reading the save's chunk
   directory numbers.
6. **Tree species art** — three iterations of species machinery built on the
   assumption that maps author species tiles. One `findprop` against a vanilla
   cell would have shown otherwise immediately.
7. **Ground tile weights** — measured from hand-authored Muldraugh and applied
   to procedurally generated land. The generator's actual recipe was sitting in
   readable Lua the whole time.
8. **Renderer scale heuristic** — showed trees as ground-level shrubs for two
   rounds, and 43 sprites as missing, because of a width heuristic and a
   hardcoded pack list.

## 17. Building orientation — the grid admits no rotation

Raised 2026-08-10. Partly CONFIRMED from the format already recorded here,
partly UNVERIFIED and needing a vanilla sample.

### CONFIRMED, from §10 and the renderer

A room is `int32 x, y, w, h`. No rotation field, no polygon, no vertex list.
A room can only be expressed as a union of axis-aligned rectangles. Walls are
north/west edges per square, so the geometry has no diagonal wall primitive
whatever sprite art exists. The camera is fixed isometric: a wall sprite is
drawn for one facing and cannot be rotated at render time.

So an off-axis footprint is not a cosmetic problem. Walls are objects on
squares and will happily stair-step, but the room they enclose either fails
to register or registers as a staircase of 1-wide rects with wall runs
between the steps. That breaks room detection, room-type loot tables, and
every validation rule planned for the editor. **The current generated map
has this pattern.**

### UNVERIFIED — the two checks, before any code

1. **Is the constraint hard or merely dominant?** Count Muldraugh rooms with
   `rectCount > 1` whose rects form a diagonal run (successive rects offset
   by ~1 on both axes, with `w` or `h` near 1). **Zero across 90,827 rooms
   means the snap may refuse outright. Nonzero means it is a strong default
   with an override**, and one such room must be read before deciding which.
2. **Which orientations do wall tiles declare?** `PaletteScan "$PZ/media"
   walls_exterior_house_01` and read the discriminators the tiles carry.
   Expectation: north, west, and a corner post; nothing diagonal.
   **Falsifier: any orientation value that is none of those.** If one
   exists, the wall model underneath A3 is wrong before A3 is written.

Note §11: `wall` is a bare flag with no orientation, and `attachedN` /
`attachedW` validated at 99.5% while being wrong. Whatever discriminator
check 2 turns up must be shown to be the tile's own declaration, not another
correlated proxy.

### `FootprintSnap` — one module, two callers

The same invariant serves GIS import and interactive authoring, which is the
§2 test for whether GIS work earns its place. A proposed footprint goes
through the snap and comes out aligned, or is refused.

- **GIS import.** Per-footprint min-area-rectangle alignment is **wrong** —
  it squares each building against itself and randomises them against each
  other and the roads, which looks deliberate and is worse than the zigzag.
  Real towns align to a street grid. Take each footprint's min-area-rect
  angle mod 90 deg (a rectangle's orientation is 90 deg-periodic), histogram
  weighted by footprint area, and rotate the **entire scene** — buildings,
  roads, area polygon — by the dominant mode before rasterizing. Residual
  per-building deviation then snaps to the nearest 90 deg.
  **Prediction to write down before running it:** a US grid town shows one
  mode holding well over half the footprint area within +/-3 deg. Flat or
  bimodal means the area has no single grid, and whole-scene rotation is the
  wrong move for it — that is the case needing per-cluster rotation.
  Roads stair-step fine in vanilla, so rotating them costs nothing.
- **Editor.** Rectangle tools axis-aligned; free rotation in 90 deg
  increments only, because arbitrary rotation is unrepresentable rather than
  discouraged. The snap is the ergonomic face of a rule the validator
  enforces anyway.
- **A4 rule: wall run not expressible as a room rect.** This is the
  enforcement point. It catches hand-painted zigzags whatever tool made
  them, and it catches imported data that skipped the rotation pass. Snap
  without the rule leaves the invariant unenforceable on imported data.

### Consequence to remember

Rotating the scene divorces the map from true north. Nothing in game depends
on that today, but `worldmap.xml` (§15) and any future GIS overlay do — the
rotation angle must be stored with the import, not discarded.

---

## 18. Session 2026-08-10 — A1 closed, and what it turned up

### A1: `outlineRoom` offsets are CORRECT

Two independent lines, neither of which is our own writer checked through
our own reader:

**Vanilla measurement.** `Probe roomgeom "$PZ/media" "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"
42_40`, 86 rooms. The discriminating comparison is the same classifier at
two positions: south `ry+rh` 67.0% vs `ry+rh-1` 10.2%; east `rx+rw` 83.9%
vs `rx+rw-1` 3.7%. **Ratio, not rate** — this is what makes it immune to the
§11 `attachedN` failure, where 99.5% absolute was wrong. A miscalibrated
wall classifier would have to be positionally biased to flip those.

The worked example carries more weight than the percentages.
`weldingworkshop [57,169 12x12] z=1`, against four predictions written down
before it was run:

| Predicted | Observed |
|---|---|
| `(rx, ry)` carries both edges | `+` at 57,169 |
| `(rx+rw, ry)` west only | `W` at 69,169 |
| `(rx, ry+rh)` north only | `N` at 57,181 |
| **`(rx+rw, ry+rh)` carries neither** | `.` at 69,181 |
| runs of `rw` and `rh` | 12 and 12 |

48 placements on 47 distinct squares.

**Source inspection.** `CellEditor.outlineRoom` loops north over
`x0 .. x0+w-1` at `y0` and `y0+h`, west over `y0 .. y0+h-1` at `x0` and
`x0+w`, and never touches `(x0+w, y0+h)`. That is `2w + 2h` placements on
`2w + 2h - 1` squares — exactly what vanilla measures.

**The instrument already existed.** `Probe roomgeom` is where §10's
"86 rooms, both far sides confirmed" came from. §2's open thread was stale
when it was written. *Check what this project already does, not only what
vanilla does.*

### Test 30 is void, not negative

`roomgeom` on generated 200_200 printed `outlineRoom's offsets are WRONG`.
Discard that conclusion. Two reasons:

1. **GIS buildings never call `outlineRoom`.** They are a bbox rect with
   walls traced round the footprint polygon — a different code path.
2. **The input is the §17 zigzag.** `room [199,221 26x15]` is a 390-square
   bounding box containing a diagonal parallelogram of walls. Walls sit at
   neither `ry+rh` nor `ry+rh-1`; the diagonal crosses both rows once. 24.1
   vs 22.2, and 10.4 vs 14.6 flipping the other way, are two coin flips.

**`roomgeom` has no margin test and no axis-alignment test, so it stated a
confident conclusion from noise and nearly retired a correct convention.**
A probe that cannot say "I don't know" manufactures findings. Both guards
are in §15.

### Room rects can exceed their building

Independent of orientation: a bbox over a non-rectangular footprint marks
~200 outdoor squares as members of `room`. Membership drives loot spawning
and every A4 rule. The fix is the §17 constraint arriving from the other
side — a room must be a union of rects covering interior squares only.

### Vanilla `spawnpoints.lua` — CONFIRMED, and not what §7 said

`$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY/spawnpoints.lua` is `posX`/`posY`/`posZ` only, no
`worldX`/`worldY`, values in absolute world tiles:

```
cellX = posX / 256      localX = posX % 256
```

Verified: `posX=10770, posY=10271` -> cell 42_40, local 18,31 -> an interior
carpet square inside `room 23 'livingroom' rect [14,31 5x6]`. All 21
spawnpoints fall in cells 41-43 x 36-41, a coherent town block. Sets are
`poor_houses` (10), `medium_houses` (5), `rich_houses` (3),
`doctor_houses` (2), `police_station` (1), merged per profession.

**Our write path emits the legacy `worldX`/`worldY` form and works
(test 15), so the reader accepts both.** Likely `worldX` defaults to 0,
making `posX` absolute. **UNVERIFIED** — confirm in the decompiler before
switching `GisCells` to the absolute form. If it holds, the 300-tile
conversion that caused the three-session spawn bug can be deleted outright.

### The per-square room id is dead

`room id: -1` on every interior square sampled — 3 squares, 3 rooms, 2
cells. Room membership is derivable **only** from lotheader rects. Two
consequences: A4 rules need a spatial index over `RoomDef` rects built per
cell (the same index §17's snap needs), and `CellEditor` should not be
writing a field vanilla ignores. Three samples is not a sweep; widen it
when the rooms dump exists.

### Smaller notes

- **`LotHeader`'s class comment is stale.** It says the B42 trailer is
  "deliberately left unparsed and exposed as raw bytes"; `readB42Meta`
  parses it completely and `Probe lotheader` reports `0 unidentified
  bytes`. Same drift class as the CHARTER problem, one level down.
- **The §10 3-int32 room object records are in better shape than
  UNVERIFIED implies.** The trailer fit `leftover = 1 + buildings +
  roomRefs` across 4064 cells and consumes to zero remainder. That is
  structural evidence for the record width; it still says nothing about
  meaning (§4).
- **`chunkGrid` is probably zombie density.** B41 reads
  `(width/10)*(height/10)` into a field named `zombieDensity`; B42 reads
  `byte[1024]` = 32x32 into `chunkGrid`, values 0..10. Same range, same
  role, resolution moved to per-chunk. Test in §15.
- **`unknown12`** in the B42 trailer is still unnamed.
- **Objects carry four facings, walls two edges.** The chair at 42_40 16,33
  has `Facing W` and a `chairW` flag. When §17 check 2 runs, scan `Facing`
  across wall tiles specifically — if walls only ever take N/W while
  objects take all four, that is the cleanest statement of the constraint
  the data will give.
- **`Probe` argument shapes are undocumented.** `lotheader` takes a file,
  `square` and `roomgeom` take a media dir plus a map dir. Two commands
  were run wrong this session for want of a usage line.
- **`grep` is aliased to `ugrep`**, which is POSIX-strict. GNU `\|`
  alternation matches LITERALLY and returns nothing. Two greps this session
  silently reported "not found" for symbols that were present. Use `-e`
  repeated, or `-E`. Same class as the `ls`/eza gotcha in §5.

## 19. Wall vocabulary, and four attempts at an alignment test

### The wall orientation vocabulary — CONFIRMED (§17 check 2 closed)

From `PaletteScan "$PZ/media" walls_exterior_house_01` and
`--prop Facing`:

| Flag | Role | `edgeOf` |
|---|---|---|
| `WallW` | west edge | WEST |
| `WallN` | north edge | NORTH |
| `WallNW` | corner, renders both segments on one square | BOTH |
| `WallSE` | **pillar/post, owns no edge** (`PaintingType = pillar`) | NONE |
| `WindowN/W`, `DoorWallN/W` | openings in a wall | NORTH / WEST |

**No diagonal wall primitive exists in the tile vocabulary.** That is the
strongest available evidence for §17's constraint — stronger than counting
rooms, because it is a property of the art rather than of one town.

`Facing` is an OBJECT property: N/S/E/W across ~6,200 tiles (the chair at
42_40 16,33 has `Facing W`). No wall tile carries it, and no tile of any
kind carries a diagonal facing. Objects have four facings; walls have two
edges plus a corner and a post.

**The A1 classifier audits clean.** `wallOn` requires `isStructuralWall`
AND a matching `edgeOf`. `WallSE` returns NONE so pillars never counted;
`WallNW` returns BOTH, which is correct; overlays are excluded by
`isOverlay`. `edgeOf` reads declared `Wall*` flags rather than inferring,
so it sidesteps the §11 `attachedN` trap by construction.

**But `edgeOf` has a live bug.** Its final block falls back to
`attachedN`/`attachedW` — the proxy the method's own comment warns about.
Unreachable from `wallOn`, but `edgeOf` is public and A3 will call it on
neighbours, where a grime overlay would report `Edge.NORTH`. Listed in §15
as an A3 prerequisite.

### The corpus sweep — `roomgeom --all`, 4065 cells, ~78s

```
rects:        152317 total
   tested:     29928  (19.6%)
   untestable 122384  (80.3%)   under 4 on a side
   off-level:      5

untestable rects by shorter side:   1: 46482   2: 45928   3: 29974
```

**The 80.3% is the important number, not the alignment result.** Vanilla
rooms are decomposed into thin strips — 46,482 rects are 1 square wide.
Any validation rule reasoning about a rect's interior is inapplicable to
four-fifths of the corpus. **This constrains A4's design more than the
orientation question does.** A4 must work at 1xN.

Also: `prisoncells [193,203 5x54]` appears identically at z=0,1,2,3.
Multi-storey rooms repeat per level, so "room with no exit" has to treat
vertical connectivity separately from horizontal.

### Four attempts at the alignment test

Recorded in full so none is retried. The question: **is this rect's wall
geometry expressible as a rectangle at all?**

| # | Approach | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fraction of interior rows carrying a wall, exclude above 25% | **674 false positives.** On a 4-wide rect one partition is 33%. Flagged bathrooms, halls, barns and printed "off-axis rooms exist in vanilla" |
| 2 | Least-squares slope of per-row mean wall x; exclude slope~1, r2>=0.9 | **Cleared all 674 — and the known diagonal too.** The rect holds two parallel runs, so the per-row mean jumps (203, 220, 203) and r2 came out 0.227. Averaging destroyed the structure |
| 3 | Concentration: fraction of walls on the two densest lines, exclude below 0.45, either axis | GIS caught at 0.19/0.20. Vanilla down to **53 false positives** |
| 4 | Same, but require BOTH axes low (`&&` not `\|\|`) | **CONFIRMED 2026-08-11.** 0 non-aligned across 29,928 testable rects; all 3 GIS diagonals still caught |

**Attempt 4 is the first version to pass both calibration cases at once** —
the known positive is caught and every known negative is clear. Attempts 1,
2 and 3 each failed one side. The rule it encodes: *a diagonal spreads walls
across every line on both axes; a partition spreads on one axis only.*

Measured concentrations, before attempt 3 was written:

| Shape | north | west |
|---|---|---|
| GIS diagonal `[199,221 26x15]` | 0.192 | 0.200 |
| clean rect `weldingworkshop` | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| rect + one partition (synthetic) | 1.000 | 0.667 |

**Why attempt 4 should work.** Every one of the 53 survivors has one axis
at or near 1.00 and the other low — `prisoncells` 0.30/1.00, `stable`
1.00/0.38, `bathroom` 0.42/1.00. Partitions run parallel to one axis, so
they can only spread walls along one axis. **A diagonal is low on both by
construction** — all three GIS rooms are 0.19/0.20, 0.21/0.23, 0.43/0.29.

**The lesson worth keeping.** Three of four attempts produced a confident
printed conclusion from a broken measure, and two of those conclusions were
about vanilla's properties. §4 says a test that cannot fail proves nothing;
the corollary is that **a test which has never been run against a known
positive AND a known negative has not been calibrated.** Attempt 3 was the
first checked against both before shipping, and it was still wrong — but
wrong in a diagnosable way, because the failures came with numbers.

### Status of §17

Check 2 (vocabulary) is CLOSED and supports the constraint. Check 1 (does
vanilla ever go off-axis) is **still open**: the current best answer is no
off-axis room among 29,928 testable rects, but that is 19.6% of the corpus
and comes from a test that has been wrong three times. `FootprintSnap`
should not be designed on it yet.

**UPDATE 2026-08-11 — check 1 CLOSED, with a stated limit.** Attempt 4
returns 0 non-aligned across 29,928 testable rects while still catching all
three known GIS diagonals, so the test is calibrated on both sides rather
than only one.

The limit is real and should be quoted alongside the result: **the finding
covers 19.6% of rects.** The other 80.3% are untestable because they are
under 4 on a side, not because they are suspect — a 1-wide rect has no
interior for walls to spread across, so "expressible as a rect" is close to
vacuous there.

**Two independent lines now agree**, which is what §4 asks for: no vanilla
room is off-axis among testable rects, and no diagonal wall primitive
exists in the tile vocabulary at all (§19). The second covers the whole
corpus rather than a fifth of it, and is the stronger of the two.

**Conclusion for design: `FootprintSnap` should refuse off-axis footprints,
not warn.** The earlier "warn, not refuse" recommendation came from the
broken guard and is retracted (§13).

---

## 20. A2 scoping — the deletion is not wholesale

A2's premise is intact. `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces TREE/BUSH/PLANT
per tile on load (§9), so the ~7,800 authored trees are discarded whatever
our code does. The chunk is still worth doing, and the proof is still
"delete, regenerate, confirm nothing changes in game".

What the call sites add, from `grep -rn -e TreeScatter -e TreePalette
-e WorldGenOverride src/` on 2026-08-10:

```
GisCells.java:61        TreePalette.pick(ti, sprites)
GisCells.java:63        TreeScatter.place(g, treePal, SEED)   -> treeAt
GisCells.java:150-151   treeAt[gx][gy] pushed onto the square stack
GisCells.java:220       writeWorldGenOverride(mapDir, cellsX, cellsY)
BiomeMapWriter.java:74  TreeScatter.distanceToStructure(g)
```

**`BiomeMapWriter` depends on `TreeScatter.distanceToStructure`.** That is
grid geometry — distance from each square to the nearest structure — not
vegetation placement, and it is load-bearing for the biome map, which is
what removed the visible seam (test 27). Deleting the class outright breaks
the thing that most recently worked.

So A2 is three separable pieces, only one of which is a deletion:

1. **Delete `TreeScatter.place` and `TreePalette`**, and the `treeAt` write
   at GisCells:150. Move `distanceToStructure` to a geometry helper first;
   that move should be byte-identical on its own, which makes it a
   separately provable step.
2. **Stop writing `WorldGenOverride.lua`.** Independent of the above and
   testable with no code change at all: delete the file from the generated
   mod directory, load, compare. If nothing changes, the write goes.
3. **Open question, not cleanup.** Biomes drive vegetation in
   engine-generated terrain; we also write tree tiles into authored cells.
   Do both target the same squares? If the engine populates authored cells
   too, vegetation is being decided twice by different rules, and which one
   wins is a behaviour question worth knowing before the editor authors
   vegetation deliberately.

**Proof mechanism for step 1**, unchanged from the charter: hash every
generated file before and after.

```fish
find ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport -type f | sort | xargs sha256sum > /tmp/before.sha
# delete, rebuild, regenerate
find ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport -type f | sort | xargs sha256sum > /tmp/after.sha
diff /tmp/before.sha /tmp/after.sha
```

**Prediction: the lotpacks differ** — the tree tiles really are written, so
removing them changes our output. The claim under test is not "the bytes
are identical" but "the loaded map is identical", which is why this one
needs the in-game check rather than a hash alone. The hashes are still
worth taking: they say *which* files changed, and anything other than the
lotpacks changing would be a surprise worth chasing.

**The `gisimport` command line is not recorded anywhere in this document.**
It was needed twice this session and guessed wrong both times. Whoever runs
A2 should paste the working invocation into §6.

---

## 21. Ground is regions, not a per-square mix

### A2 step 2 — CONFIRMED, `WorldGenOverride.lua` does nothing

Moved out of the generated mod directory, loaded in game 2026-08-11.
**No seam. Foliage flows cleanly across the boundary between authored cells
and engine-generated land** — dense mixed forest on one side, open grass
with saplings on the other, trees crossing coherently. The biome map is
doing that work. Remove the write.

Incidental confirmation for A2 step 1: the trees look right, and they are
the engine's, not ours. `genMapSquare` deleted our authored trees and
generated its own from the biome map — which is the claim the deletion
rests on.

**RETRACTED, same day. This paragraph is wrong, or at least unproven —
see §25.** It was written before `BiomeMapWriter`'s scope note was read and
before the generated cell was probed for tree tiles. Both point the other
way. A2 step 1 is BLOCKED, not ready.

### The ground defect, and what causes it

Generated ground reads as scattered tan diamonds in green grass. Probing
eight adjacent squares in generated 200_200:

```
Grass_Dark, Grass_Dark, Grass_Dark, Grass_Light,
Grass_Dark, Grass_Dark, Grass_Medium, Grass_Medium
```

Sixteen adjacent squares in vanilla 35_35: **`Grass_Dark`, all sixteen.**
No alternation whatsoever.

Sixteen samples spaced 16 apart across the same vanilla row: a long grass
region, a `Road_04` crossing, then a dirt region alternating `Dirt` and
`Dirt_Grass` square by square.

**So vanilla ground is two-level, and `GroundPalette` collapses it into
one:**

1. **Region** decides the ground TYPE — grass here, dirt there, road there.
   Large-scale, coherent, driven by what the place is.
2. **Within a region**, mix a small set of tiles that belong together:
   `Dirt` with `Dirt_Grass` to make a worn unpaved surface, or the four
   interchangeable variants of one grass colour.

`Grass_Dark`, `Grass_Medium` and `Grass_Light` are **level-1 distinctions.**
We are treating them as level-2 texture. That is backwards, and it is why
generated ground reads as noise.

### Why the survey did not catch it

The Muldraugh survey measured how OFTEN each group appears — 70 / 21 / 10 —
and reproduced those proportions faithfully, per square. It never measured
how they are ARRANGED. A 14.5% share can be 14.5% scattered uniformly or
14.5% in coherent regions, and those look nothing alike.

**Same failure shape as §4's round-trip caveat and the §11 `attachedN`
bug: a measurement that validates in aggregate while being wrong about the
thing that matters.** Frequency is not distribution.

### Consequence: the dirt groups should come back

Test 27 dropped `dirt` (64/69/70/71) and `dirt_grass` (80/85/86/87) because
they read as bare diamonds scattered through forest. That fixed the symptom
correctly, but the cause was the same one-level collapse — and
`GroundPalette`'s own comment already said so: *"Dirt is still the right
floor for a track, a yard or an unpaved road. It just should not be
scattered through open country at random."*

Vanilla confirms it: the dirt region in 35_35 alternates `Dirt` with
`Dirt_Grass` per square, exactly the level-2 mix. Once regions exist, dirt
returns and unpaved tracks and yards become possible — a capability the
current palette gave up.

### Before building a noise field

**Check whether the region signal already exists.** The biome map drives
vegetation and removed the seam; if biome type predicts ground group, the
region layer is already there and unread, and the fix is a lookup rather
than new noise. Falsifier: sample ground material against biome across a
vanilla cell and see whether they correlate.

Only if they do not is a value-noise field over world coordinates the right
approach — selecting the GROUP at a scale of roughly 8-20 squares, with
uniform choice among the four variants within a group, which is genuinely
per-square. Overlays can stay per-square; they read as texture, not colour.
Either way the measured proportions are preserved exactly.

### Loose thread

Sixteen ground probes on vanilla 35_35 produced 25 `FloorMaterial` lines.
Some squares carry two ground tiles. The survey recorded that no square out
of 257,703 had two overlays; a stacked BASE is a different claim and is not
obviously allowed by it. Unexplained.

---

## 22. `chunkGrid` is zombie density — CONFIRMED, and ours is empty

### The evidence, three independent lines

1. **Structural.** B41 reads `(width/10)*(height/10)` bytes into a field
   the legacy format literally names `zombieDensity`. B42 reads
   `byte[1024]` = 32x32 into `chunkGrid`. Same role, resolution moved from
   per-10-tiles to per-chunk.
2. **Value range.** Vanilla uses 0..10, matching the B41 field.
3. **Behavioural, 2026-08-11.** Zombies spawn on vanilla ground and none
   spawn on ours. The boundary sits exactly where our authored road ends.
   **This is the independent source §4 asks for — not more testing of the
   same kind.**

### The distributions

```
vanilla Muldraugh, 4,162,560 chunks:
  0 -> 4,013,741    1 -> 47,276    2 -> 72,702    3 -> 17,993
  4 ->     7,455    5 ->    448    6 ->    595    7 ->  1,579
  8 ->        91    9 ->    140   (10 present)

generated PZGisImport, 4,096 chunks:
  0 -> 4,096        (every byte, all four cells)
```

**96.4% of vanilla chunks are zero, so a zero-heavy map is normal.** The
defect is not that we have zeros; it is that we have nothing else. And the
nonzero values are far from uniform — 1, 2 and 3 carry most of the
population while 8, 9 and 10 together are about 0.005% of chunks. Anything
that writes these must not spread values evenly across the range.

### The trap, which is the same one as §21

That histogram is a **frequency** measurement. Reproducing it by rolling
per chunk would get the numbers right and the arrangement wrong — density
clusters around habitation, and a town cell and a forest cell are not two
samples from one distribution. **Frequency is not distribution**; this is
the third time that error has appeared in this project (§11 `attachedN`,
§21 ground groups, here).

### Three consumers now want the same thing

- **Ground groups** need to know whether a place is grass, dirt or road
  (§21).
- **Zombie density** needs to know whether a place is inhabited (§22).
- **The biome/zone map** already encodes something close to this and is
  written per tile (§6).

All three are asking *what is this place*, and **GIS land use already
answers it** — parks, fields, residential, industrial — from real data
rather than invented noise. That is a strong argument for building the
region layer once, as shared infrastructure, rather than solving ground and
density separately.

It is also the §2 test passing cleanly: a GIS feature that the editor needs
regardless of who authors the tiles.

### Testing a fix

Unusually clean: write plausible density, regenerate, walk the same
boundary, see whether zombies appear on our side. **Use a fresh world** —
a resumed save may have baked spawn data for chunks it has already seen.

### Note on `Probe lotheader`

It stops at tile names and does not print the chunk grid, though
`LotHeader` parses it. The histogram above came from `Probe survey`, which
takes ~90s on Muldraugh and prints nothing until it finishes when piped
through `grep`.

---

## 23. Density written — the mechanism works

`GisCells.writeChunkDensity`, added 2026-08-11. A chunk holding building
tiles gets 2, a chunk orthogonally adjacent gets 1, everything else stays
0. Footprints come from `buildingRects(g, ox, oy)`, already clipped to the
cell, so the density write does not depend on the raster loop.

### Predicted before running, from building geometry alone

1530 building tiles over 8x8 chunks is ~24 chunks packed perfectly,
realistically 40-70 once footprints straddle boundaries, each with up to
four orthogonal neighbours. So: **40-70 twos, 80-150 ones, 95%+ zero.**

```
0 -> 3935  (96.1%)     1 -> 89     2 -> 72
```

**72 and 89, and 96.1% zero against vanilla's 96.4%** — a number not tuned
for, since the rule was written from building geometry rather than from
matching the histogram.

### In game, fresh world

**Zombies at the building, none on the way to it.** First ever seen on the
generated map. Both halves held, including the negative one: they appear
where we wrote 2 and are absent where we wrote 0.

### What this does and does not establish

**Confirmed:** `chunkGrid` gates zombie spawning, and writing nonzero
values makes zombies appear at those chunks. The plumbing works.

**Not established:** whether 2 is the right value. Vanilla's range runs to
10 and seven buildings at density 2 is a hamlet, not a town. Three zombies
is evidence the mechanism fires, not evidence the quantity is right.

**Open, and worth a proper measurement:** how vanilla's nonzero values
correlate with what a place is. §4 prefers the recipe to the output, so
the engine's own spawn code is a better source than measuring Muldraugh —
but Muldraugh at least says whether density tracks building footprints,
road frontage, or something else. And the import already distinguishes
`Agriculture` from `Residential`; a farm outbuilding and six houses
probably should not carry identical density.

### A region signal already exists

From the `giscells` output:

```
town 17374, edge 28242, forest 77031, deep 87233, beyond-raster 52264
```

**The biome map already computes a four-class per-tile classification.**
That is precisely the region signal §21 needs for ground groups and §22
argued should be built once and shared. It exists, it is per tile, and
`GroundPalette` does not read it.

Whether those four classes map usefully onto grass dense / medium / light
is untested — but reading an existing classification is a much smaller
piece of work than building a noise field, and it should be ruled out
first.

---

## 24. Ground stacking — §21's model is incomplete

### Regions vary within a cell

Six samples across vanilla town cell 42_40 at y=200:

```
x= 20   Grass_Medium
x= 60   Sand + Grass_Medium
x=100   Sand
x=140   Grass_Dark
x=180   Grass_Dark
x=220   Grass_Dark
```

Contiguous regions at 40-tile spacing, three materials in one cell. This
kills the fallback that regions might be arbitrary hand-picked fields —
there is structure. Forest cell 35_35 is uniformly `Grass_Dark` across
every sample taken (§21).

### But the driver is NOT distance from habitation

That comparison suggested it: 42_40's houses are in the west (spawnpoints
at local x 18-58) and `Grass_Medium` sits at x=20-60 with `Grass_Dark`
from x=140 out. A fine transect does not bear it out:

```
x=100  Sand
x=104  Sand
x=108  Grass_Dark
x=112  Grass_Medium + Grass_Dark x4      <- FIVE ground tiles
x=116  Grass_Medium + Grass_Dark
x=120  Grass_Medium + Grass_Dark
x=124  Grass_Medium + Grass_Dark
x=128  Grass_Dark
x=132  Grass_Dark
```

The Medium band at 112-124 sits **inside** Dark, with Dark on both sides.
That is not one region meeting another, and it is not a habitation
gradient. It may be a path, a mown verge, or the blend around the Sand
feature. Unknown.

### The finding that matters: vanilla stacks ground tiles

**A square can carry several base ground tiles, not one base plus at most
one overlay.** x=112 carries five. This is the explanation for the
"25 lines from 16 probes" thread left open in §21, and it is the blend
mechanism — overlapping tiles from neighbouring regions soften the
boundary.

**So §21's model is incomplete.** Ground is region, then texture within
the region, **then a blend layer of stacked tiles at boundaries.** We
write exactly one base plus at most one overlay, so even with perfect
regions our transitions would be hard-edged where vanilla's are soft.

### Why the next step is the recipe, not more measurement

Three hypotheses about ground were formed and complicated by data in a
single session: per-square frequency (§21), distance banding, and now a
clean region boundary. Each time the measurement was of **Muldraugh, a
hand-authored town** — which §13 already warns against imitating.

§4: *prefer the recipe to the output.* The blending logic lives in the
engine or in TileZed's authoring behaviour, and reading it will settle in
one pass what four transects have not. Two candidates:

- `blends_natural_01` tile naming and properties — is there a convention
  encoding which pairs blend, and in which direction?
- The engine code that assembles ground squares at load.

**Ground appearance matters** — it is currently the most immersion-breaking
defect in the generated map — so this is a real chunk, not a curiosity.

## 25. Tree ownership — UNRESOLVED, and it blocks A2 step 1

A2 step 1 rests on the claim that the engine discards our authored trees.
**That claim is not established, and two findings point against it.**

### Evidence for (the original basis)

§9: `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces TREE/BUSH/PLANT per tile on load.
§11: the engine substitutes species and appearance for the generic
`vegetation_trees_01_*` tiles, so varied beautiful trees in game are
compatible with our writing generic ones.

### Evidence against

1. **`BiomeMapWriter`'s own scope note**, added when that class was
   written: *"WorldGen only generates chunks where
   `IsoChunk.hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()` is true. Since GisCells fills
   every square of every chunk, none of ours are generated, so the BIOME
   band may currently do nothing for us."* If WorldGen never runs on our
   chunks, it never places trees on them either.
2. **Our tree tiles are in the file.** `Probe findprop ... 200_200 tree`
   returns `vegetation_trees_01_8 / _10 / _11` with `tree 2`, at authored
   positions. `TreeScatter` wrote 7,797 trees and they are on disk.

These are not necessarily contradictory — `genMapSquare` and WorldGen
chunk generation are different mechanisms, and one could run while the
other does not. That ambiguity is exactly what `BiomeMapWriter` flags as
UNVERIFIED.

### The test, which was started and not finished

**Positional.** Pick authored tree squares away from the cell edge, convert
to world coordinates, walk that line in game.

- Trees at exactly those coordinates, bare ground between → **positions are
  ours.** `TreeScatter` is live and A2 step 1 must not proceed.
- Trees along the line at unrelated positions → **the engine re-scatters.**
  A2 step 1 stands.
- Dense forest everywhere → the engine is adding on top of ours, and a
  different test is needed.

A first attempt used cell 200_200 local x=0, which is world x=51200 and sits
on the map edge — not usable. Pick interior squares (local x roughly
120-180) instead.

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe findprop "$PZ/media" \
    ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport 200_200 tree
```

World coordinate for cell 200_200 local (x,y) is (51200 + x, 51200 + y).

### Density in the screenshots is a hint, not evidence

7,797 trees over four cells is about 3% of squares. The forest in the
2026-08-11 screenshots looks considerably denser than 3%, which would
suggest the engine is adding trees rather than only substituting art for
ours. Not conclusive — canopy sprites overlap and hide bare ground — but
worth holding in mind when the positional test is run.

### A fifth mechanism: `Fix2xMap` rewrites tile names at load — CONFIRMED

Found 2026-08-13 while rendering a vanilla reference for E7, not by looking
for it. `IsoChunk` holds a static legacy-name translation table applied to
**every tile as the chunk loads**, before any of the mechanisms above run.
Three kinds of entry:

| kind | example | effect |
|---|---|---|
| direct rename | `vegetation_groundcover_01_0` → `blends_grassoverlays_01_16` | tile becomes a different tile |
| deletion | `vegetation_groundcover_01_6` → `""` | tile vanishes |
| randomised substitution | `vegetation_foliage_01_0..16` → `randBush` | resolved per load to `f_bushes_1_(64 + Rand.Next(16))` |
| randomised substitution | `vegetation_groundcover_01_18..23` → `randPlant` | resolved per load to `d_plants_1_(Rand.Next(4)*16 + Rand.Next(8))` |

Also covers `walls_exterior_house_01_20..31`, `walls_exterior_roofs_01_24..41`
→ `walls_exterior_roofs_03_*`, and several `location_shop_greenes_01_*`.

**Why this matters to §25 directly.** The "Evidence against" above rests on
`Probe findprop` returning `vegetation_trees_01_8 / _10 / _11` at authored
positions. Those names being **in the file** is confirmed and unchanged. But
what the engine renders for them is not necessarily what we wrote, because a
name in `Fix2xMap` is rewritten at load. **This does not resolve tree
ownership either way** — it adds a mechanism that must be ruled in or out
before the positional test's result can be interpreted.

**Check, before running the positional test:** grep the decompiled
`IsoChunk` for the exact tile names `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette` emit. If
any appear as `Fix2xMap` keys, the test is measuring the engine's
substitution, not its scatter, and the three outcomes listed above do not mean
what they say.

```fish
grep -n -e vegetation_trees_01 -e vegetation_foliage_01 \
    ~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/IsoChunk.java
```

**Falsifier for the whole concern:** if none of our emitted names are keys in
the table, `Fix2xMap` is irrelevant to us and this note can be closed.

### Do not start from the biome bands

§23 suggested reading `town/edge/forest/deep` as the region signal. That
still may be worth doing, but it assumes the region driver is distance
from structures, and this transect does not support that. Extracting the
banding into a reusable method is worth doing regardless — three consumers
want a region signal — but mapping grass groups onto it should wait for
the investigation.

## 26. Ground blending — CONFIRMED mechanism, and the rule

E3, 2026-08-13. Full document: `docs/E3_GROUND_BLENDING.md`. Deliverable was a
document; no code was changed. This section is the summary a future session
needs; the document carries the falsifiers and the unrun checks.

### Three layers, and a naming trap

| Layer | Tileset | Flags | Per square |
|---|---|---|---|
| **solid** | `blends_natural_01`, `blends_street_01` | `solidfloor`, `diamondFloor` | exactly 1 |
| **mask** | same sheets | `FloorOverlay`, `IsFloorAttached`, `FloorAttachment{N,S,E,W}` | 0–4 |
| **tuft** | `blends_grassoverlays_01` | `vegitation`, `MoveWithWind` | 0–1 |

`GroundPalette` calls the **tuft** layer "overlay" (`OVERLAY_SHEET`,
`Ground(base, overlay)`, `overlayRate`) and has never written a mask. Use
**solid / mask / tuft**; "overlay" is now ambiguous and will cause a
misimplementation.

Stack order is solid first, masks after, tuft last — CONFIRMED on ~60 squares
across two tilesets. `getFloor()` returns the first floor object and
`cleanChunk` reads `FloorMaterial` off it, so a mask written first would be
mistaken for the floor.

### The 16-tile block contract — CONFIRMED

Source: `PaletteScan "$PZ/media" blends_natural_01`, all 160 indices. Uniform
across all seven materials. For block base **B**:

| offset | role |
|---|---|
| B+0, B+5, B+6, B+7 | solid variants, interchangeable |
| B+1 / B+2 / B+3 / B+4 | corner masks N+W / E+S / S+W / E+N |
| B+8 … B+11 | side masks N / W / E / S |
| B+12 … B+15 | side masks N / W / E / S, second variant |

B = 0 `Sand`, 16 `Grass_Dark`, 32 `Grass_Medium`, 48 `Grass_Light`, 64 `Dirt`,
80 `Dirt_Grass`, 96 `Clay`. Indices 112–127 are a further side-mask set with no
solids; 128–159 have no sprites — UNVERIFIED what they belong to. Block
regularity does **not** continue past 111.

`blends_street_01` follows the same contract: (90,190) is `_53` `Road_04` solid
with `_26` (E) and `_25` (W) `Road_02` masks.

Convention throughout: **+x East, +y South**, matching §10.

### The mask rule — CONFIRMED

Source: contiguous 9×5 rectangle, 42_40, x=110–118 y=198–202. 45 squares,
21 masks, every one checked against its actual neighbours; none unexplained.

A square carries masks drawn from its **neighbour's** block. The mask names the
direction the other material lies in. With S = the set of orthogonal directions
whose neighbour carries the higher-priority material:

| \|S\| | encoding |
|---|---|
| 0 | no mask |
| 1 | one side tile |
| 2, adjacent | **one corner tile** — not two side tiles |
| 2, opposite | two side tiles |
| 3 | two corner tiles, sharing the middle direction |
| 4 | four corner tiles |

Side masks have two interchangeable variants; vanilla uses both on identical
geometry, so pick at random exactly as the four solid variants are picked.

UNVERIFIED: the multi-material case (no square measured bordered two different
higher-priority materials); the |S|=3 case rests on one sample.

### Blending is one-way — there is a precedence table

Not one `Grass_Dark` base square in the rectangle carries a mask. All 21 masks
are Dark-on-Medium, and the relation is not reciprocal. The higher-priority
material is drawn as a mask **onto** its neighbour.

Known: `Grass_Dark` > `Grass_Medium` (21 samples) · `Grass_Medium` > `Sand`
((60,200)) · `Road_02` > `Road_04` ((90,190)).

It is **not** block-index order — Sand is block 0 and loses to Medium at 32 —
so it must be measured. Three of twenty-one `blends_natural_01` pairs known.
UNVERIFIED whether masks cross tilesets at all.

### Region boundaries are dithered

Base materials, 42_40, D = `Grass_Dark`, M = `Grass_Medium`:

```
x:      110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118
y=198:   D   D   D   D   D   M   M   M   M
y=199:   M   M   D   D   D   M   M   D   M
y=200:   M   D   M   D   M   M   M   D   D
y=201:   M   M   D   M   M   M   M   D   D
y=202:   M   M   D   M   M   M   M   M   D
```

The two materials interpenetrate per square across 2–4 squares. Interiors stay
pure — §21's 16/16 identical `Grass_Dark` in 35_35 still holds. So the model is
**region → texture (variant choice) → dither (at boundaries) → mask**. Layers 3
and 4 are separate and both are needed: dither without masks is the
scattered-diamond defect at region scale; masks without dither gives a soft but
geometrically straight edge.

UNVERIFIED that dither is a convention rather than a 42_40 hand-painting quirk.
**Check before implementing it:** a contiguous rectangle across a region
boundary in a non-town cell.

### The engine's blending pass touches only the procedural seam

`zombie.iso.worldgen.blending.Blending`, called from `IsoChunk.update()`. The
gate is `!blendingDoneFull && !Arrays.equals(blendingModified, {t,t,t,t})`,
which opens on authored chunks — but the per-direction work is guarded by
`sourceChunk.isBlendingDoneFull()`, set true only in `genRandomChunk`. **So the
neighbour must be a fully procedural chunk.** Between two authored chunks
nothing happens.

`changeGround` replaces the solid floor with `tiles().get(0)` from the
neighbouring biome's GROUND feature, random depth 0–3 inward, along each of the
8 columns of the shared edge — a ragged feathering pass, not masking.
`maxDepth = 4` is a dead constant. `BlendDirection.defaultDepth` (N 7, S 0,
W 7, E 0) are min/max seeds for `genRandomSquare`, not a blend radius.

Consequences: we author every mask ourselves; the
`contains("blends_natural_01")` guard means our roads and building floors are
immune to seam replacement while our natural ground is not.

### WorldGen can only place solid tiles

`grep -rho -e 'blends_natural_01_[0-9][0-9]*' "$PZ/media/lua/" | sort -u`
returns 28 tiles, every one a solid. **No mask tile appears in any Lua file.**
The producers partition cleanly: features place solids, `Blending` replaces
solids, only the authoring tool writes masks.

### `Sand` mid-cell is land use — Q4 answered

(60,200) is Sand solid carrying `fencing_01_59`, inside room 78
`emptyoutside` rect [53,199 8×12]. North of it: `Road_04` at (90,190), and a
`shed` room at [89,177 3×4]. Fenced open ground between a road and a shed — a
yard or lot.

This strengthens §22: land use is what GIS import already knows, and
`emptyoutside` rooms and fence tiles are co-located with it. UNVERIFIED that it
generalises; one parcel is not a rule.

### Dirt can come back — Q5 answered

`dirt` and `dirt_grass` have full 16-tile blocks with the same mask vocabulary.
Vanilla alternating `Dirt`/`Dirt_Grass` per square in 35_35 is the texture layer
behaving normally. The test-27 objection stands as an argument against
*scattering*, not against dirt: gated to tracks, yards and unpaved roads, being
bare is correct.

### What to implement, in dependency order

1. A material **priority table**. Blocks everything; three pairs known.
2. A **region layer** from GIS land use, pure interiors.
3. A **dither pass**, 2–4 squares — after running its falsifier.
4. A **mask pass**, after every square's material is final. It is a pure
   function of the four orthogonal neighbours, which is the same shape as the
   editor's auto wall-joining (Charter §1). Worth writing once for both.
5. Restore **dirt**, gated to yard/track regions.
6. Keep the tuft layer; only its naming needs changing.

Two traps: mask tiles must be declared in the `.lotheader` tile table
(`GroundPalette.all` collects solids and tufts only), and the mask pass cannot
be folded into the per-square roll in `GroundPalette.roll()` because a square's
masks depend on its neighbours.

### Noticed, out of scope

`Blending.removeTrees` is a **fourth** mechanism touching trees: along an edge
shared with a procedural chunk it deletes trees with probability ramping by
distance from the edge (`rnd.nextInt(100) >= y*10` — certain at the edge,
impossible beyond 10 squares) and substitutes `e_newgrass_1_40` or
`e_newgrass_1_42` about 75% of the time. This bears on §25: authored trees near
the map edge may be deleted by this pass rather than by `genMapSquare`, which
would confound the positional test if it is run too close to the boundary.

### `CellRenderer` — two known limitations, neither affecting the game

Found while producing the E7 reference render. **Both are renderer-only. Map
data is correct in both cases and the game is unaffected.** Recorded because
Charter §4 says the renderer is a hypothesis too, and it has now been wrong
three times.

1. **No `Fix2xMap` translation.** `CellRenderer` looks tile names up in the
   sprite atlas literally, so any legacy name the engine would rewrite at load
   is reported missing and skipped. On a 9×9 pure-grass patch of 42_40 this was
   4 of 54 distinct sprites and 13 skipped draws — all vegetation
   (`vegetation_groundcover_01_21`, `vegetation_trees_01_8/9/10`), none of them
   `blends_natural_01`. Applying the table before atlas lookup would fix this
   and every future instance. Note the randomised entries cannot be reproduced
   exactly, only sampled.
2. **Tree sprite vertical anchor.** A tree renders with its canopy sitting flat
   on the grass and, at `zTo` > 0, its trunk hanging below the ground plane.
   The tile is correct — (118,196) carries `vegetation_trees_01_9` with
   `tree 2`, a genuine vanilla tree tile. `Z_STEP = 96` and the `oy` offset
   place tall sprites wrongly relative to the floor diamond. **Owner decision
   2026-08-13: ignore.** It does not affect the game and no chunk depends on it.

**What this does not compromise:** the E7 reference render
(`docs/` or `~/Downloads/vanilla_blend_tight.png`, 42_40 x=110 y=198 size 9).
Every missing sprite was vegetation; no ground tile failed to resolve, and the
ground reads correctly. The mask layer composites properly — `CellRenderer`
draws the full square stack in stored order onto an ARGB canvas, so transparent
mask art blends over the solid beneath it. **The renderer can validate E9.**

### Renderer invocation — two argument-shape traps

`Probe render` reverses the argument order used by `square`, `findprop` and
`roomgeom`, and wants a *texture pack dir* rather than a media dir:

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe render "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY" \
    "$PZ/media/texturepacks" 42_40 110 198 9 0 0 ~/Downloads/out.png
```

`$PZ/media` yields `packs loaded: 0` and every sprite missing. And in
`Probe.java` the guard on both `zFrom` and `zTo` is `args.length > 8`, so
**passing nine arguments silently ignores `zFrom` and falls back to z 0..2.**
Pass all ten.

## 27. Ground precedence — the priority table, measured

E7, 2026-08-13. Full document: `docs/E7_GROUND_PRECEDENCE.md`. Deliverable was
a document; the only code added was `pzformat.GroundCensus`, read-only.

Measured over **4,065 cells — the entire Muldraugh retail map** — at z=0, by
`GroundCensus`, which walks every square in one JVM run. §26's mask mechanism
came from a single 45-square rectangle; this tests it at corpus scale and fills
the four holes it left.

### The material priority table — CONFIRMED

The higher-priority material supplies the mask; the lower-priority square
carries it.

**`Grass_Dark` > `Grass_Medium` > `Grass_Light` > `Sand` > `Dirt_Grass` >
`Dirt` > `Clay`**

| pair | n | pair | n |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Grass_Dark > Grass_Medium` | 8,119,438 | `Grass_Light > Dirt` | 677,353 |
| `Grass_Medium > Grass_Light` | 3,424,535 | `Grass_Light > Dirt_Grass` | 284,699 |
| `Dirt_Grass > Dirt` | 1,319,008 | `Grass_Light > Sand` | 256,784 |
| `Grass_Dark > Grass_Light` | 615,314 | `Grass_Medium > Sand` | 67,082 |
| `Grass_Medium > Dirt` | 484,489 | `Grass_Dark > Sand` | 49,306 |
| `Grass_Dark > Dirt` | 484,001 | `Sand > Dirt` | 6,140 |
| `Dirt > Clay` | 1,119 | `Dirt_Grass > Clay` | 1,038 |

**Transitivity is observed, not inferred** — `Grass_Dark` is seen masking
directly onto all six materials below it. No skip link contradicts the chain.

**It is not derivable.** Block index order is 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96; the
priority order is 16, 32, 48, 0, 80, 64, 96. Not brightness either — dark grass
outranks light grass, but pale `Sand` outranks dark `Dirt`. **Hard-code it.**

Grass consistently outranks road (`Grass_Dark > Road_04` 284,583, and so on for
every grass/road pair). Roads among themselves:
**`Road_01` > `Road_02` > `Road_04` > `Road_03` ≈ `Road_05` > `Road_07` >
`Road_06`** — UNVERIFIED as strict, since `Road_03`/`Road_05` separate at only
24:1. `Burnt > Grass_Light` (2,608); `Burnt`'s wider position is UNVERIFIED.

### Priority is a strong default, not a law

**Every pair shows both directions.** The magnitude separates two regimes:

| pair | dominant | reverse | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Grass_Medium` / `Grass_Light` | 3,424,535 | 94 | 36,400 : 1 |
| `Grass_Light` / `Sand` | 256,784 | 86 | 2,986 : 1 |
| `Dirt` / `Dirt_Grass` | 1,319,008 | 94,696 | 14 : 1 |
| `Road_01` / `Road_02` | 495 | 63 | 8 : 1 |
| `Grass_Light` / `Road_01` | 137 | 55 | 2.5 : 1 |

For natural materials the reversals are a noise floor — hand-edits, or tool
re-runs over edited ground. **Vanilla is not internally consistent here and we
should not reproduce its inconsistency.** Author from a strict table. A
validator flagging "mask direction disagrees with the table" should fire on
roughly 1 vanilla square in 3,000; that rate is itself a check the table is
right.

### Dither is general — CONFIRMED

§26 flagged dither as possibly a 42_40 quirk. The prediction going into E7 was
that forest cells would show clean edges. **They do not.**

**Mean single-square-island share: 19.97% across all 4,065 cells.** A
single-square 4-connected component is one square of material A entirely
surrounded by B; no curved, diagonal or irregular edge can produce one. One
component in five is dither.

**E8's dither pass is required, not conditional.**

**UNVERIFIED — the dither's spatial law.** We know it exists and roughly how
dense it is. Random per square, noise-driven, or patterned? How does band width
relate to the material pair? **This is the one measurement E8 still needs.**

### Block contract, completed

| sheet | masks per block | layout |
|---|---|---|
| `blends_natural_01` | **12** | 4 corners B+1..4, 8 sides B+8..15 (two variant sets) |
| `blends_street_01` | **8** | 4 corners B+1..4, 4 sides B+8..11 (**one** variant set) |
| `floors_burnt_01` | 20 at 9–31 | same vocabulary, fire damage |

Natural blocks confirmed for all seven materials, not just the one E3 measured.
**Roads have no second variant set** — code assuming the natural shape will emit
`blends_street_01_12`..`_15`, which are not road masks.

**`Clay` is the exception:** 28 indices spanning 97–127 where the block predicts
97–100 and 104–111. CONFIRMED as observation, UNVERIFIED as interpretation.
Emit only 97–100 and 104–111 and it does not block anything.

### Masks cross tilesets, and multi-material squares are common

Both were untestable in E3. Both confirmed:

- `blends_street_01_48` (Road_04) carrying `blends_natural_01_24` (Grass_Dark N).
- `blends_natural_01_16` (Grass_Dark) carrying `industry_01_58`.
- `0_36 (7,94)`–`(7,179)`: a contiguous run of `Grass_Light` carrying **both**
  `Grass_Dark` and `Grass_Medium` masks.
- `42_40 (1,77)`: `Road_04` with `Grass_Medium` and `Road_01` masks —
  multi-material *and* cross-tileset on one square.

**The rule keys on `FloorMaterial`, not on tileset.** And E9's mask pass runs
once per distinct outranking neighbour material, concatenating the results —
§26's guessed extension, now confirmed.

### The discriminator, corrected

```
isBlendMask(tile) = props.has("FloorOverlay")
                 && props.has("FloorMaterial")
                 && props.hasAny("FloorAttachmentN","FloorAttachmentS",
                                 "FloorAttachmentE","FloorAttachmentW")
```

§26's layer table implies `FloorOverlay` alone is enough. It is not — decal
sheets carry it without `FloorMaterial`.

### What E8 and E9 implement — revised from §26

1. `GroundMaterial` priority table, absolute. **CONFIRMED, do not re-measure.**
2. Region layer from GIS land use (E8).
3. **Dither pass (E8) — now required.** Target ~20% single-square islands at
   boundaries. Spatial law still unmeasured.
4. Mask pass (E9), per §26's rule with four amendments: key on `FloorMaterial`;
   use the three-property discriminator; run once per outranking neighbour and
   concatenate; emit 8 masks for street blocks, 12 for natural.
5. Restore dirt (E10).
6. Rename `GroundPalette`'s "overlay" to "tuft" — now three meanings collide
   (mask, tuft, decal).

### Named checks not run

1. **The dither spatial law** — what E8 needs, and E7 did not measure.
2. `Road_03` vs `Road_05` — the weakest link in the road order, may be no order.
3. `Burnt`'s position in the wider order. One pair observed.
4. Clay 112–127 — extra variant sets, or an eighth material?
5. Whether the noise floor is spatially clustered. If the 1-in-3,000 reversals
   concentrate in particular cells they are hand-edits; if uniformly scattered,
   something systematic is being missed.

### Noticed, out of scope

`floors_burnt_01` carries `FloorMaterial Burnt` masks and participates in the
priority system. Fire damage uses the blend vocabulary — a **third** consumer
for E9's neighbour-rule engine, alongside ground and A3's wall-joining.

---

## 28. Ground regions and the dither law — E8, and the defect is fixed

E8, 2026-08-14. **This chunk built.** The scattered tan diamonds that opened E3
are gone; generated open country now reads as coherent grass with yards, verges
and softened boundaries. Render: `docs/e8_final.png`.

New code: `GroundMaterial`, `GroundRegions`, `DitherLaw` (read-only
measurement). Changed: `GisCells` takes ground from the region layer.
`GroundPalette` untouched — its tuft model is measured and sound.

### Part 1 — the dither law is INDEPENDENT PER SQUARE

§27 left this as the one measurement E8 needed. `DitherLaw` answered it.

**CONFIRMED.** Matched-distance lift, `P(both minority) / P(minority|d)²`
measured between adjacent squares **at equal signed distance** so a varying p
cannot manufacture a correlation:

| pair | window 5 | window 9 | window 15 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dark/Medium | 1.125 / 1.102 | 0.935 / 1.023 | 0.956 / 0.950 |
| Medium/Light | 1.137 / 1.100 | 1.012 / 1.007 | 0.947 / 0.956 |
| Dark/Light | 1.381 / 1.636 | 1.198 / 1.022 | 0.948 / 0.985 |

(x-adjacency / y-adjacency. They agree, so this is not a scan artifact.)

On the boundary contour, on 8,000+ pairs against 200–600 in the tails,
**adjacent squares are independent.** Two thirds of contour minority components
are singletons, mean size 2.06.

**The 5–10× lift at |d|>2 is a different population, not correlation.** A
single correlated field cannot give ρ≈0 at p=0.46 and ρ≈0.7 at p=0.085 —
mutually exclusive. Minority component size by distance settles it: 2.06 on the
contour against 4–165 further out, with singletons falling from 66% to 0%.
Those are **genuine small regions the majority filter smoothed away**, which is
also why P floors at 0.03–0.05 at |d|=8 instead of decaying to zero.

**So: no noise field.** Distance transform from the region edge, one Bernoulli
draw per square.

**Two failed approaches, recorded because both looked right.** The first
independence test pooled run-lengths across d=−8..+8 where p ranges 0.02–0.32;
a mixture of p values produces excess long runs *and* a deficit of k=1 runs
(observed ratios 0.65–0.84 at k=1) even under perfect independence. It could not
distinguish correlation from varying p. The profile is also strongly
filter-dependent — P(minority) at d=0 runs 0.318 → 0.421 → 0.455 across windows
5/9/15 — so **band width is UNVERIFIED** and only bracketed.

### Part 2 — what was built, and what the data would not support

`GisImport.Cover` is `{NONE, ROAD, BUILDING}`. **There is no landcover import.**
§22 and §27 both say "the import already carries land use"; that is true of
developed surfaces and false of everything else. So:

| source | material | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `NONE` far from anything | `Grass_Dark` | the 58.6% majority; one region |
| within 3 of `BUILDING` | `Sand` | §26 Q4 — 42_40's mid-cell Sand is a fenced yard between a road and a shed |
| within 2 of `ROAD` | `Grass_Medium` | §26 — Medium appears as a verge at 42_40 (60,200) |

**Multiple grass regions across open country are unbuilt for want of data, not
by choice.** A noise field would be inventing a driver E3 ruled out and §27 left
unsupported. Owner decision 2026-08-14.

`YARD = 3` and `VERGE = 2` are **guesses**, isolated as constants. The only
evidence is one hand-authored lot.

**Seeding.** `GisCells` seeds its `Random` per cell so a cell regenerates
identically regardless of its neighbours. The dither flip is therefore driven by
a **position hash**, not that sequential `Random` — otherwise the same world
square dithers differently depending on which cell is written, and every cell
border becomes a seam.

### The dither rate is FITTED, not derived

Vanilla's measured P(minority|d) cannot be used as an input flip probability —
different quantities. Four data points, cell 200_200, against vanilla 42_40:

| P[0] | 1 nbr | 2 nbr | 3 nbr | 4 nbr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **vanilla** | **53.6%** | **37.8%** | **7.3%** | **1.3%** |
| 0.00 | 63.0% | 36.6% | 0.3% | 0.0% |
| 0.06 (shipped) | 56.4% | 35.9% | 5.4% | 2.2% |
| 0.14 | 52.8% | 34.2% | 9.2% | 3.9% |
| 0.27 (derived) | 47.5% | 34.0% | 12.7% | 5.8% |

Shipped: `P = {0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.005}`.

**Strongly sublinear** — 0→0.14 buys 3.9 points of 4-neighbour, 0.14→0.27 only
1.9 more. Saturation: once a boundary square has flipped there is nowhere new
to go.

**There is no geometric floor.** P=0 gives 0.0% 4-neighbour and one island in
65,536 squares, refuting the prediction that yard corners and the road diagonal
would produce isolates on their own.

### OPEN — the shape mismatch we cannot tune away

**Vanilla's 3-neighbour and 4-neighbour targets cannot be hit simultaneously.**
The shipped profile straddles them: 5.4% against 7.3%, and 2.2% against 1.3%.
Every rate over-produces true isolates relative to 3-neighbour squares.

That is a **shape** difference, not a rate. Vanilla's minority squares form
short chains along the contour (mean component 2.06, two-thirds singletons);
ours are pure independent draws, which give proportionally more isolates.
**Lift ≈ 1.0 at d=0 is a weaker claim than matching the component-size
distribution**, and the gap between those two claims is exactly this residual.

**Check for a future session:** compare our minority component-size histogram
against vanilla's directly, rather than the differing-neighbour histogram. If
vanilla's chains come from its regions being hand-painted with softer shapes
than our geometric buffers, the fix is region shape, not dither.

### Predictions that failed, all four

Recorded because Charter §4 says a test that cannot fail proves nothing, and
because the ones that failed were the ones that taught something.

1. **Dither is a noise field.** Refuted — lift ≈ 1.0 at the contour.
2. **The band runs 3–5 squares.** Unscoreable; the profile is filter-dependent.
3. **Halving P halves the islands.** It moved 5.8% → 3.9%. Sublinear.
4. **A geometric floor of ~2.5% exists.** P=0 gives 0.0%.

What survived every check was the independence result. The rate is a curve fit
to four points and should be labelled as such wherever it is used.

### Verified numerically, not by eye

The difference between P=0.27 and P=0.06 is **barely visible in the render**
while the census channels moved by a factor of three. Tuning ground by eye would
not have found this. `GroundCensus` run against our own output is the check that
works; use it.

## 29. The mask pass — E9, and §26's four-layer model is complete

E9, 2026-08-14. **Built, verified against vanilla, verified against our own
output, and verified in game.** Ground material boundaries are now soft.
Render: `docs/e9_fixed.png`.

New code: `MaskRule` (pure), `MaskAudit` (read-only). Changed: `GroundMaterial`
gains sheets, per-material solids, variant-set counts and the seven road types;
`GroundRegions` gains `addMasks` and a bordered `build`; `GisCells` calls the
mask pass at all three ground sites; `GroundPalette`'s "overlay" renamed to
"tuft".

### The rule, confirmed over 22 million masks

`MaskAudit` walks every square of every named cell, computes the neighbour
materials, and checks what vanilla actually wrote. Over the whole Muldraugh map:

| geometry | encoding | share | n |
|---|---|---|---|
| \|S\|=1 | one side tile | 99.9% | 7.9M |
| \|S\|=2 adjacent | **one corner tile** | 99.4–99.7% | 4.45M |
| \|S\|=2 opposite | two side tiles | 99.6% | 3.1M |
| \|S\|=3 | two corners sharing the middle | 99.2–99.4% | **1,288,832** |
| \|S\|=4 | four corner tiles | 99.1% | 210,412 |

**§26's `|S|=3` and `|S|=4` clauses each rested on ONE observation.** They are
now the best-attested things in the project. The owner chose to measure before
building rather than implement on n=1 and fix later; it cost one session and
settled both.

**Unexplained masks: 0.809%** — a mask whose material is on no side. Not spread
evenly: three cells gave 0.033%, and two pairs dominate the total,
`Road_01 on Road_07` (71,936) and `Grass_Light on Dirt_Grass` (61,303). So the
residue is **clustered in specific cells**, which is the answer §27's open check
was asking for: they are localised authoring, not a broken rule.

**UNVERIFIED — a possible missing clause.** One probe found a diagonal-only
neighbour taking a **side** tile: 0_34 (117,210) is `Grass_Dark` carrying a
`Grass_Light` E-side mask, with `Grass_Light` at the NE diagonal (118,209) and
on no orthogonal side. **Not implemented** — n=1 is exactly what this session
just spent a measurement refusing to build on, and 0.8% is inside tolerance.
**Check:** extend `MaskAudit` to record diagonal geometry, ~20 lines.

### Roads

Seven road types added with their **real** shapes, which are not uniform:

| block | material | solids | masks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Road_01` | 0, 5 — **two only** | 8 |
| 16 | `Road_02` | 16, 21 — **two only** | 8 |
| 32/48/64/80/96 | `Road_03`..`Road_07` | four | 8 |

`blends_street_01` has **one** mask variant set; `blends_natural_01` has two.
Emitting B+12..15 for a road would write tiles that do not exist.

Roads join the material array so grass can mask onto them — §27 measured
`Grass_Dark > Road_04` at 284,583 — with ranks 0–6 natural and 10–16 road, so
every natural material outranks every road by construction. **The dither
explicitly skips road boundaries**: interleaving would put grass squares in the
carriageway and road squares in the field. A road edge is hard, softened by
masks only.

The mask belongs on the LOWER-priority square, so grass masks are written on the
**road** square. The road branch in `GisCells` had to call `addMasks` too; until
it did, the census reported no road pairs at all and the array change looked
inert.

### The N/W transposition

`MaskRule.Dir` was declared `N(0, -1, 0), W(1, 0, -1)` against a constructor of
`(ord, dx, dy)`. **N carried dx=−1 — it pointed west; W pointed north.** On a
diagonal boundary that put roughly half the mask art on the wrong edge of its
square and rendered as a regular sawtooth along the road.

Caught by: 200_200 (20,166) has `Grass_Medium` to its **north** at (20,165) and
carried `blends_natural_01_45`, a **west** side mask, its own
`FloorAttachmentW` confirming it. After the fix, `_40` with `FloorAttachmentN`.

The self-test now asserts the direction table directly — dx, dy, ord and
opposite() — so this cannot recur silently. 12/12 cases pass.

### Verified against our own output

`MaskAudit` pointed at `$GISMAP` rather than Muldraugh:

| geometry | encoding | share |
|---|---|---|
| \|S\|=3, all four orientations | the single correct encoding | **100.0%** |
| \|S\|=4 | `[1, 2, 3, 4]` | **100.0%** |
| unexplained masks | — | **0.000%** |

Vanilla runs 99.1–99.7% with an 0.809% unexplained floor because it carries
hand-edits; we author from a strict table, so our map is **more internally
consistent than Muldraugh**. `GroundCensus` agrees: Q1 holds exactly the
boundaries the region layer creates, all in the correct direction, and Q2 is
empty.

**This is the test that would have caught the transposition in one run**, and it
did not exist until after the render found it. `MaskAudit` works on any map
directory; point it at our output after any change to the mask path.

### Verified in game

A fresh world at the generated map shows grass bleeding onto the sand yard in
soft irregular fringes rather than stepping square by square — **the masks
render**. That closes §26's out-of-scope worry that `attachmentsDoneFull`
defaults to true and `applyAttachments` might never run on authored chunks. It
evidently does not block mask art.

The road reads as plain unmarked asphalt at 7 squares, correct for its Census
class `S1400` ("Co Hwy 26", half-width 3).

### OPEN

1. **Yards are much larger than `YARD = 3` suggests.** A large irregular
   footprint puts many squares within 3 of *some* part of it, and the union
   reads as an 8–10 square apron. Region shape, not mask behaviour. `YARD` and
   `VERGE` remain guesses isolated as constants (§28).
2. **The diagonal mask clause**, above.
3. `Road_03` vs `Road_05` still separate at only 24:1 (§27). Nothing depends on
   it yet.
4. The buildings are black slabs with no roof or interior detail — `TilePalette`
   writes one interior floor tile and nothing above. A-track, untouched here.


---

## 30. Building footprints — orientation is not a measurement problem

2026-08-14, following E9. Measured with two new read-only classes,
`FootprintAngles` and `RoomShapes`. No code changed.

### The reframe: the target angle is known in advance

§10: a room is a union of `int32 x, y, w, h` rectangles. No rotation field, no
polygon, no vertex list. So **every wall runs due north-south or east-west,
and the target orientation is 0° — fixed by the format, not discoverable from
data.**

An axis-aligned edge lands exactly on the tile grid: no rounding, no steps.
**Jaggedness is not a defect in its own right, it is the SYMPTOM of an off-axis
edge.** The generated road demonstrates both halves — its straight runs are
perfectly clean and only its diagonal stretches stair-step.

Shape is free. L-shapes, T-shapes, wings and courtyards are all representable
as unions of rectangles. **Edge direction is not.**

This retires §17's search for a dominant grid. There is nothing to rotate *to*.

### §17's whole-scene rotation fails on this data anyway

`FootprintAngles` computes each footprint's minimum-area rectangle by rotating
calipers over its convex hull, takes the angle mod 90° (a rectangle's
orientation is 90°-periodic), and histograms area-weighted.

| # | angle | area m² | w × h m |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 76.16 | 122 | 12.3 × 9.9 |
| 1 | 37.08 | 158 | 16.1 × 9.9 |
| 2 | 71.15 | 173 | 23.5 × 7.4 |
| 3 | 37.79 | 219 | 14.9 × 14.8 |
| 4 | 65.05 | 76 | 12.3 × 6.2 |
| 5 | 61.18 | 301 | 22.2 × 13.6 |
| 6 | 80.27 | 341 | 19.8 × 17.2 |

Best ±3° window: **33.3%** of footprint area. §17 predicted "well over half"
for a grid town. **The prediction failed and the falsifier fired as written** —
flat means no single grid.

The reason is not a flaw in the method: at 39.05N 83.64W this is rural Ohio,
seven farmsteads over 1,391 m², each building squared to its own parcel. §17's
prediction was about a town and this is not one. **Whole-scene rotation may
still be right for a dense grid town; it is wrong here, and it is unnecessary
everywhere, because 0° is known in advance.**

`FootprintAngles` warns below 30 footprints. Three agreeing by chance looks
exactly like a grid.

### Vanilla's shape vocabulary — CONFIRMED over 90,827 rooms

`RoomShapes` over all 4,065 Muldraugh cells, reading lotheaders only:

| rects per room | share |
|---|---|
| 1 | **64.5%** |
| 2 | 18.7% |
| 3 | 9.7% |
| 4 | 4.1% |
| 5+ | 2.9% |

**93% of vanilla rooms are three rectangles or fewer.** Fill ratio (summed rect
area over bounding box) has median **1.000**, p10 0.714, and **64.5% are
exactly 1.000** — a plain rectangle.

**So faithfully tracing a real GIS outline would produce buildings MORE complex
than vanilla's.** An axis-aligned bounding box of the right area is closer to
what vanilla does than the true polygon would be. This is the finding that
decides how the snap works.

Bounding boxes are small: 1-4 × 1-4 dominates at 43,529, then 5-8 × 5-8 at
16,260. These are interior rooms — closets, bathrooms — not buildings.

### The type vocabulary is already enumerated

Room names across Muldraugh, by count: `bathroom` 16126, `bedroom` 11375,
`livingroom` 11222, `kitchen` 7725, `empty` 5704, `closet` 5397,
**`emptyoutside` 5242**, `office` 3976, `hall` 3749, `garagestorage` 1496,
`kidsbedroom` 1483, `derelict` 1339, `laundry` 1197, `janitor` 802,
`motelroom` 715, `diningroom` 694, `storageunit` 668, `garage` 588.

`emptyoutside` at 5,242 confirms §26 Q4: **yards are authored as rooms**, which
matters when we synthesise one around a building.

### The real gap is interior subdivision, not orientation

We write **8 rooms for 7 buildings** — one open box each. Vanilla writes a
cluster per building: bathroom, bedroom, livingroom, kitchen, closet. That is
what makes a building read as a building, and it is what "drop a real building
of the right type on the footprint" actually requires.

### So the snap is not a rotation

Given the above, `FootprintSnap` takes a GIS footprint and returns an
**axis-aligned rectangle of matching area at the same location**, tagged with
the occupancy class the import already carries (`Agriculture`, `Residential`).
Orientation is 0° by construction, so jaggedness cannot occur. Outline fidelity
is deliberately discarded because vanilla has less of it than the source data
does.

### §17 check 1 — ANSWERED. The axis constraint is HARD.

Open since 2026-08-10. `RoomShapes` with a corrected detector — three or more
rects stepping consistently in the same direction, not merely a pair — over all
90,827 Muldraugh rooms: **107 runs, 0.12%.**

And the 107 are not staircases. Every one is a room whose boundary *widens*
step by step:

```
2_38  hall       [118,33 4x1] [116,34 6x1] [114,35 8x1]
21_48 cave       [275,190 3x1] [274,191 8x1] [273,192 10x1] [271,193 12x1]
21_48 cave       [304,153 19x1] [302,154 21x1] [300,155 21x1] [298,156 8x1]
```

Rows 4, 6, 8 wide: the left edge steps left while the rect grows. That is a
splayed or funnel-shaped room, and the third example widens then collapses — an
irregular cavern outline. **Every individual edge is still north-south or
east-west. Not one off-axis wall exists in 90,827 rooms**, because the format
cannot express one.

What varies is how finely an author chooses to approximate a curve with steps,
and they do so rarely and mostly in caves, where a ragged natural outline is
the intent.

**Consequence for E5: `FootprintSnap` may REFUSE off-axis input outright.**
There is no vanilla practice it would be rejecting. A person drawing a diagonal
wall in the editor should be told no.

**And it sharpens what our buildings do wrong.** Ours stair-step because a
polygon was rasterised. Vanilla's 107 step because an author chose to
approximate a shape. Same visual primitive, opposite provenance — and the
difference is exactly what E5 removes.

Note `min(w,h) == 1` is **30.52%** of vanilla rects and is *not* a jaggedness
signature on its own. Corridors, closets and wall-thin rooms are all one square
wide by design.

### OPEN
1. **Rooms per building, and which types co-occur.** A `Residential` recipe is
   bedroom + bathroom + kitchen + livingroom; `Agriculture` is something else.
   This is the subdivision recipe and it has not been measured. `LotHeader`
   rooms carry no building id, so it needs a clustering pass — adjacent rooms
   sharing walls — or reading `objects.lua`.
2. **Room size targets.** Our footprints are 76–341 m² at one square per metre;
   vanilla's building bounding boxes have not been measured, only its rooms'.


---

## 31. Buildings are rectangles now — E5, and two wrong diagnoses first

2026-08-14. `FootprintSnap` added; `GisImport` rasterises snapped rectangles
instead of polygons. Verified by `Probe roomgeom`, by render, and in game.

### The defect

`Probe roomgeom` on our own map excluded **all 3 rooms** in 200_200 as *"not
axis-aligned"*, with north-wall concentration **0.19–0.43** where an aligned
building gives ~1.0:

```
'room' [103,89 14x14] z=0 — north conc 0.43 (28 walls), west conc 0.29 (28 walls)
```

The room rect was a clean 14×14 bounding box. Its 28 north-wall squares were
scattered along a diagonal outline. **The room and its walls described
different shapes** — that is the black slab with a ragged fringe in game.

Cause: `GisImport.fillPolygon` wrote the true polygon at 37–80° into
`Cover.BUILDING`; `deriveWalls` traces `Cover.BUILDING`; `GisCells` computed
the room rect independently as a bounding box.

### Two wrong diagnoses, and what corrected them

**First** I proposed snapping the room rects. `RoomShapes` pointed at our own
map killed it immediately: 8 rooms, 8 rects, fill ratio 1.000, zero
staircases. The room rects were already perfect rectangles and snapping them
would have changed nothing.

**Second** I proposed deriving walls from the room rect. That would have given
straight walls over a floor that still followed the polygon — the interior
would not have filled the room.

**Both were caught by `Probe roomgeom`, which already existed**, already had
"excluded as not axis-aligned" in it, and already cited §17. Nobody had pointed
it at our own output. Same lesson as `MaskAudit` in §29: **an instrument built
to measure vanilla works just as well on our map, and running it there is what
catches implementation bugs rather than model bugs.**

### The fix

`FootprintSnap.snap` returns an axis-aligned rectangle preserving the
footprint's **area** and **centroid**, with aspect ratio from the minimum-area
enclosing rectangle — so a long barn stays long, it merely stops being rotated.
It scales to the polygon's area rather than the enclosing rectangle's, which
would otherwise inflate every building by roughly 1/cos of its angle.

`GisImport` fills that rectangle. `deriveWalls` then traces a rectangle and
emits four straight runs, so **floor, walls and room rect describe the same
shape by construction** and jaggedness cannot occur.

Self-test: an already-aligned 10×6 comes back byte-identical — the snap is a
no-op on good input, which matters for the editor caller.

### Results

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `roomgeom` 200_200 | 0 measured, 3 excluded | **3 measured, 0 excluded** |
| north / south / west | 0.19–0.43 conc | **100.0%** |
| 200_201 and 201_201, all four sides | — | **100.0%** |
| building tiles | 1,530 | **1,391** |
| derived walls | 278 N / 256 W | 244 N / 156 W |

1,391 matches `FootprintAngles`' measured total footprint area of 1,391 m²
exactly — area is preserved to the square.

In game: a single unbroken wall run along the north face, a clean corner,
another straight run down the east. No steps anywhere.

### OPEN

1. **East wall 63.0% in 200_200 only** (17 of 27), against 100% in both other
   cells. The off-by-one alternative scores 0.0%, so it is not a convention
   error — 10 walls are simply absent. Likely two buildings adjacent in x,
   where the shared boundary correctly gets no wall. Local, not `deriveWalls`.
2. **The yard apron may be too wide.** `YARD = 3` measured from a rectangle
   covers more ground than from a thin polygon. **Measure it before changing
   it** — the road looked far too wide in three separate renders and was
   exactly the 7 squares its Census class specifies. Isometric projection
   makes a strip read wider than it is.
3. **Interior and roof are still absent.** `TilePalette` writes one interior
   floor tile and nothing above, so a building is a black void with walls. Now
   the most visible defect, since straight walls no longer distract from it.
   A-track, and E13's subdivision work sits on top of it.


---

## 32. The scale is verified, and the snap keeps its precision

2026-08-14, immediately after §31. Prompted by adding an area cross-check that
fired on its first run.

### One PZ tile is one metre — CONFIRMED to 0.4%

The footprints are FEMA/ORNL USA Structures, and every feature carries its own
`SQMETERS`. Comparing that against the tiles we write is a free check of the
entire projection-and-snap path, and it did not exist until now.

**Total building tiles 1,409 against `SQMETERS` summing 1,403** over seven
footprints — 0.4% over. Before the precision fix it was 1,391, 0.9% under.

Every import since the first has assumed one tile is one metre. **Nothing had
ever verified it.** It holds.

### Two quantisation losses were stacking, both downward

The check reported a worst case of **27.9%** — a building the dataset records
at 83.3 m² rendered as a 12×5 = 60 tile rectangle.

**First loss: `GisImport.project` rounded every vertex to an integer tile
before `FootprintSnap` could measure the polygon.** All seven footprints
measured below their recorded area — 122.5 against 127.4, 164.0 against 169.1,
175.0 against 179.8 — never above. A systematic 2–7% shave, and unrecoverable
downstream because the precision was already gone.

**Second loss: the rectangle's two sides were rounded independently.** A few
percent on a large building; dominant on a small one, where a single square is
a large fraction of a 6-wide side.

### The fix

`projectExact` keeps sub-tile precision and buildings use it. **Roads keep the
integer `project`** — `thickLine` walks tile centres and wants them.

Rounding now **rounds the longer side and derives the shorter from the area**,
rather than rounding both. Independent rounding discards the one quantity that
matters.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| total tiles vs `SQMETERS` 1,403 | 1,391 (−0.9%) | **1,409 (+0.4%)** |
| worst single building | **27.9%** | **13.5%** |
| 15% warning | fires every import | silent |

The 13.5% residual is not ours. That footprint's polygon measures 77–81.5 m²
depending on projection origin, so the dataset's own 83.3 sits ~5% above the
geometry it ships with. We round 77 down to 72: one square on a 6-wide side,
the irreducible cost of an integer grid.

### Why this was worth fixing rather than muting

A 5% area error is invisible in game. What made it worth an hour is that **the
check would have fired on every single import**, and a warning that always
fires is one that gets ignored — which is precisely how the `findprop` 3-hit
cap (§27) and the confounded run-length test (§28) each survived a full
session. A check that cries wolf is worse than no check.

### The import carries far more than we were using

Every USA Structures feature has 36 properties; we read one. Now carried into a
`GisImport.Building` record, for E13's interior recipes:

| field | why |
|---|---|
| `OCC_CLS` | the coarse class. Vocabulary is small — Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Agriculture, Education, Government, Utility, Religion, Assembly, Unclassified — so a per-class recipe is tractable, not a taxonomy problem. |
| `PRIM_OCC` | the finer class. Duplicates `OCC_CLS` on this rural extract; in a town it splits Commercial into retail, office, restaurant. |
| `OUTBLDG` | flags an outbuilding. Null on all seven here, but it is the barn-versus-farmhouse distinction, and a barn wants one undivided room. |
| `SQMETERS` | the dataset's own area — the cross-check above. |

`HEIGHT` is null throughout this extract, so storeys cannot be derived from it.

This extract holds `Agriculture` ×1 and `Residential` ×6, at 39.05N 83.64W in
Highland County, Ohio.

### OPEN

1. **`FootprintSnap.hull` can return a duplicate vertex.** Observed on the
   83.3 m² footprint: `[88,-143]` appeared twice in the hull. Harmless for the
   minimum-area rectangle, but it means near-degenerate rings reach the
   rotating calipers, and on a smaller building two vertices could merge
   entirely. Andrew's monotone chain with `<= 0` should collapse collinear
   points; it did not here.
2. **`$GISMAP` silently empties** between fish sessions and has now cost three
   round trips, failing differently each time — `NoSuchFileException` on a cell
   name read as a path, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and empty output
   under `2>/dev/null`. Set it in the same command as any probe that uses it.


---

## 33. The building recipe — measured, and the rule that governs it

2026-08-14. Three read-only classes: `RoomCluster` (rooms into buildings, then
size-conditioned types, parcel companions and host distance) and `HallRule`
(what distinguishes a building with a hallway from one without). No code
changed.

### The governing decision — owner, 2026-08-14

**GIS is authoritative for what exists. Gameplay is additive.**

Every real footprint stays a real building of its real class. Where the game
needs something the data does not supply, it is **added and attached to a GIS
building** — a garage beside a house, a barn near the farmhouse — rather than
reclassifying a house into a shed.

Two reasons, and the second is the stronger one:

1. Real-world data does not balance for gameplay, and this is going in a game.
   **Room type IS loot type**: `garagestorage` gates tools and fuel,
   `farmstorage` gates seed. A town of nothing but houses is one where whole
   item categories never spawn, so the *tail* of the distribution is
   gameplay-critical and must not be rounded away.
2. Reclassification destroys the provenance distinction permanently and
   invisibly. Additive placement keeps the two sources separable, so a future
   session can always ask which buildings came from data and which we added.

**Consequence:** a synthesised building must record its host, so a parcel stays
a parcel. `GisImport.Building` needs a provenance field — cheap now, impossible
to reconstruct later.

### Clustering rooms into buildings

`LotHeader` rooms carry no building id, so rooms are unioned when their rects
touch or sit one square apart — one square because a wall lives on the shared
edge. Unioned across floors too, since a two-storey house is one building.

Over 4,065 cells: **9,038 buildings from 85,585 interior rooms**, plus 5,242
`emptyoutside` yards excluded (they touch several buildings and would bridge
them into one blob).

**Known limits, both inflating the tail:** a terrace or strip mall merges into
one building, and a building straddling a cell boundary counts as two. The
floors histogram shows the damage — 17, 24, 28 "floors" are downtown blocks
unioning vertically. **Do not read floor counts off this.** Room counts and
type sets are unaffected.

### Size predicts type, strongly

Sampling the global mix unconditioned would give 80-square garages and
12-square houses. It does not:

| footprint | n | most common |
|---|---|---|
| ≤24 | 2,049 | **`garagestorage` 52.0%**, `empty` 10.2%, `shed` 3.6% |
| 25–60 | 1,477 | 4-room dwelling core 20.2%, +closet 14.4%, `garagestorage` 12.4% |
| 61–120 | 3,293 | **5-room core 28.5%**, 4-room 11.8%, +office 4.3% |
| 121–240 | 1,084 | core + garage + hall + laundry 4.5%, `barn` 3.7% |
| 241–480 | 663 | core + kidsbedroom 22.2%, `empty + producestorage` 5.0% |
| >480 | 472 | fragmented — `catwalk + railroadrepair`, warehouses |

The dwelling core is `bathroom + bedroom + closet + kitchen + livingroom`,
14.2% of all buildings; without closet 7.7%; with kidsbedroom 4.5%. **Counts
when present:** bathroom 2.75, bedroom 2.45, livingroom 2.39, kitchen 1.61 —
a house is two-ish bathrooms and bedrooms, one kitchen.

`garagestorage` alone is the **second most common building in Muldraugh at
14.0%**. The outbuilding case is a seventh of everything, not an edge case.

### What accompanies a dwelling, and how near

**45.1% of dwellings have an outbuilding within 40 squares; 37.8% specifically
have a `garagestorage`.** Then `shed` 2.6%, `picnic` 1.2%, `garage` 0.8%,
`farmstorage` 0.7%, `barn` 0.6%.

Host distance, Chebyshev between centres: **p10 8, median 18, p90 94.** The
type breakdown is what makes the 40-square cutoff meaningful rather than
arbitrary:

| type | n | mean | within 40 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `garagestorage` | 1,181 | 18.8 | **93.4%** |
| `shed` | 75 | 38.3 | 73.3% |
| `farmstorage` | 40 | 47.5 | 47.5% |
| `grocery` | 26 | 73.5 | 34.6% |
| `electronicsstore` | 25 | 90.7 | 24.0% |

A garage is genuinely attached to its house. A grocery is merely elsewhere in
town and the nearest-dwelling search found it anyway. **40 squares separates
"outbuilding of this parcel" from "unrelated building nearby".**

Measured per cell, so a host across a boundary is missed — biases the
distribution SHORT, never long.

### Vanilla's buildings are the same size as our footprints

p10 4×3 = 12, **median 10×8 = 80**, p90 18×19 = 342 squares. Our GIS
footprints are 76–341 m² at one square per metre — the same range. **Our
buildings are not too large**; they sit between vanilla's median and its p90.

### The hallway rule — room count, and the transition is at 6–7

`hall` appears in only 17.4% of buildings, so 82.6% connect door-to-door with
no corridor. A subdivider that always cuts a hallway would be wrong five times
in six. Five candidate discriminators were measured at once so the data would
pick:

| | with hall | without |
|---|---|---|
| rooms, median | **9** | **4** |
| area, median | 120 | 80 |
| aspect ratio | 1.27 | 1.33 |
| private room fraction | 0.50 | 0.50 |
| would route through a private room | **28.2%** | **1.9%** |

**Aspect ratio and private fraction explain nothing.** Room count separates:

| rooms | hall rate |
|---|---|
| 2–3 | **6.1%** |
| 4–5 | 14.4% |
| 6–7 | **57.3%** |
| 8–10 | 84.9% |
| 11–15 | 90.0% |
| 16+ | 87.5% |

**A clean sigmoid with the transition at 6–7 rooms.** Under 6, connect
door-to-door; from 8, use a hall.

The private-routing test is real but secondary — 28.2% against 1.9% is a 15×
ratio, so it is a genuine signal, but it fires on only a quarter of
hall-having buildings. **Access is the underlying reason; room count is what
predicts when access breaks down.** At 8+ rooms in a rectangle you cannot
arrange things so everything is reachable without either a corridor or walking
through bedrooms.

A further 17.0% of hall-having buildings become **adjacency-disconnected** with
their hall removed, against 0.0% of hall-less ones — for a third of these the
hall is structurally load-bearing, not merely convenient.

### What E13 now has, and what it still needs

**Measured and ready:** which rooms by footprint size; how many of each;
whether to cut a hall; what to add to a parcel and at what distance; that our
footprint sizes match vanilla's.

**Design settled:** sample the distribution rather than always taking the mode,
with guardrails so a small import is never pathological; `OCC_CLS =
Agriculture` gets a `barn` interior outright, because that is real data telling
us what the building is.

**Still unmeasured — the layout itself.** The recipe says *which* rooms, not
where. §30 found 93% of vanilla rooms are ≤3 rects and 64.5% exactly one, so a
recursive split into axis-aligned sub-rectangles should match the shape
vocabulary. Unverified: whether vanilla's internal walls span their region
(a BSP signature) or meet in T-junctions and pinwheels, and what the room area
ratios are by type — a bathroom is small, a livingroom large, and if those
ratios are stable the subdivider can allocate by type rather than splitting
evenly and labelling afterwards.

### OPEN

1. The layout measurement above.
2. **Every room must be reachable**, which is Charter §1's *"room with no
   exit"* validation seen from the other side. Generate it correctly and you
   can detect it — A4 should inherit whatever E13 builds, the way A3 inherits
   `MaskRule`.
3. Detached garages are **too small to appear in USA Structures at all** —
   bucket A is empty in our import. Every garage on our map will be synthesised.


---

## 34. Room layout — a BSP, plus a circulation pass

E14, 2026-08-14. `RoomLayout`, read-only. This is the last measurement E13
needed.

### The layout IS recursively splittable — 85.0%

Tested by trying to split: take the building's extent, look for a full-span cut
that no **rect** straddles, recurse on both sides, and check that every leaf
holds rects of one room only. That is the definition of a binary space
partition applied directly.

| rooms | splittable |
|---|---|
| 2 | **100.0%** |
| 3 | 98.3% |
| 4 | 93.3% |
| 5 | 86.0% |
| 6 | 76.3% |
| 7–12 | 77–85% |
| 13+ | 40–70%, noisy |

**Overall 85.0% of 8,580 multi-room buildings.** Falling with complexity,
never collapsing.

### The 15% that will not split is the HALLS

The failures are not pinwheels. They are one shape, over and over:

```
4_37  hall[9,135 10x1][11,136 8x1][17,137 2x1]
3_37  hall[25,222 4x1][25,223 3x2][23,225 5x1][20,226 7x1]
2_38  hall[173,128 7x1][175,129 2x2]
```

**A hall snakes.** Three or four thin rects stepping around corners, threading
between rooms. That cannot come out of recursive splitting, because the hall is
not a leaf of a partition — **it is the negative space left over after the
rooms are placed.**

### So the algorithm is: split, then carve

1. **Recursively split** the building rectangle to place the rooms. Allocate
   area by type using the ratios below, not evenly.
2. **Carve a hall** through the leftover, when room count says one is needed.

This matches §33 from the other direction. Halls appear by room count — 6.1% at
2–3 rooms, 57.3% at 6–7, 84.9% at 8–10 — and the BSP rate dips to 76–80%
exactly across that same range. **The two measurements are the same fact seen
twice**: where a hall is needed, a pure partition stops being sufficient.

### Room area by type — stable and strongly differentiated

`× mean` is the room's area over its **own building's** mean room area, so a
mansion and a cottage are comparable.

| type | × mean | median sq | p90 sq | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `closet` | **0.11** | 2 | 4 | 3,689 |
| `janitor` | 0.16 | 9 | 30 | 532 |
| `laundry` | 0.24 | 6 | 15 | 1,030 |
| `bathroom` | **0.27** | 6 | 12 | 11,406 |
| `office` | 0.60 | 27 | 90 | 2,741 |
| `kidsbedroom` | 0.81 | 15 | 24 | 1,153 |
| `bedroom` | **0.83** | 16 | 25 | 7,635 |
| `kitchen` | **1.03** | 24 | 30 | 6,649 |
| `diningroom` | 1.17 | 20 | 40 | 511 |
| `garage` | 1.26 | 30 | 48 | 527 |
| `lobby` | 1.50 | 28 | 99 | 332 |
| `livingroom` | **1.80** | 42 | 70 | 7,873 |
| `hall` | 1.83 | 40 | 126 | 2,764 |

A livingroom is **6.7× a bathroom**. Splitting evenly and labelling afterwards
would produce a house with a 42-square bathroom, which is the difference
between a plausible building and a grid of equal boxes.

The absolute medians are what E13 allocates from: bathroom 6, bedroom 16,
kitchen 24, livingroom 42, closet 2.

### The instrument was wrong first, and the check that caught it

The first run reported **10.5%** and I read it as "vanilla is not a BSP". It
split on **bounding boxes**. A room's box is not its shape — §30 measured 35.7%
of rooms as multi-rect, and an L-shaped livingroom's box swallows whatever
occupies the notch, so boxes overlap where the rooms tile perfectly.

**The tell was in the output and I nearly missed it: 2-room buildings scored
66.1%.** Two rooms failing to separate with a single cut is close to
impossible. A number that cannot be right is a statement about the instrument,
not the map — and after the fix it reads 100.0%.

Third time this pattern has cost a cycle: the confounded run-length test (§28),
the first diagonal-run detector (§30), and now this. All three produced clean,
plausible numbers that happened to agree with the hypothesis being tested.

### OPEN

1. **The carve step is unspecified.** We know a hall is thin (median 40 squares
   at 1.83× mean, so long and narrow) and that it snakes. We do not know how
   vanilla routes it — along one wall, down the middle, or wherever the rooms
   leave a gap.
2. **Multi-rect rooms are 35.7%** and a pure BSP produces only rectangles. Some
   of that is rooms wrapping a hall; the rest is unexplained. E13 can ship
   rectangles-only and look right; this is what would make it look *authored*.

## 35. Building interiors — E13, partly built and NOT finished

2026-08-14. **Read this section before touching `BuildingPlan`.** A great deal
was measured and most of it is sound; the room-list algorithm at the end is
mid-rewrite and demonstrably wrong. Both are recorded.

### What works, and is verified

**Interiors exist.** `BuildingPlan` produces typed room rects, `GisCells`
writes them into the lotheader and stamps room membership per square.
`RoomCluster` pointed at our own map reads back ~44 rooms across 8 buildings
where there were 8, with a rooms-per-building spread rather than 100%
one-room.

**Interior walls and doors.** A wall on the north or west edge of a square
wherever two rooms meet (§18's convention, as `deriveWalls` uses for
exteriors), verified by probe: exactly one wall per boundary, on the correct
square, in the correct orientation.

**Doors along a SPANNING TREE.** Cut one door per graph edge that first
connects a new room. A spanning tree reaches every node by definition, so **no
room can be walled in** — the guarantee is structural rather than
probabilistic, which matters because an unreachable room is invisible until
someone walks into the building. Charter §1 names *"room with no exit"* as a
validation rule; this is the same knowledge applied at authoring time, and A4
should walk the same graph in the other direction.

**Exterior doors exist and are correct in the data** — verified at 200_201
(43,69) and (43,84), each carrying `walls_exterior_house_01_1` (wall) plus
`_11` (door). **They are invisible in a render** because `CellRenderer` draws
the opaque wall sprite over them. Fourth time this session the renderer has
been the limitation rather than the map (§31, and the mask transposition, the
tree canopy, the road width before it).

**`TilePalette` gains interior walls and doors.** `walls_interior_house_01` is
a clean 16-tile block, same shape as the ground blends: B+0 `WallW`, B+1
`WallN`, B+2/3 corners, B+8/9 windows, **B+10/11 the doors**, B+12..15
variants. 436 tiles under `walls_interior` carry a `DoorWall` property.

### The house grammar — owner's rules, tested against Muldraugh

Stated as architecture, not as a distribution, then measured over 400 cells,
283 houses and 229 exterior doors (`HouseRules`).

| rule | vanilla | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| The exterior door never opens into a bedroom | **1 of 229** | **CONFIRMED, a law** |
| The livingroom faces the road | 62.5% | true but weak |
| The kitchen is opposite the livingroom | 58.7% | true but weak |
| Livingroom and kitchen may be open to each other | **55.4% fully open** | **the reverse of my prediction** |
| Small bedrooms share a bathroom rather than having ensuites | ensuite 6 vs 171 off-core | CONFIRMED |

**The entrance set is wider than livingroom and kitchen.** Of 229 exterior
doors: livingroom 31.0%, kitchen 26.6%, **hall 17.9%**, **laundry 9.6%**,
lobby 5.7%, diningroom 2.6%. The hall entrance is the front-door-into-a-hallway
house and the laundry entrance is the back door into a mudroom; both are common
enough to include, and both are now in `BuildingPlan.ENTRANCE`.

R1 and R2 are followed anyway despite being weak. A generator that is
consistent produces more coherent houses than vanilla's 62%, and nobody
complains that a town is too tidy.

### Room minimums — MEASURED, and this is what the rewrite needs

A median is not a minimum. `RoomMinimums` over 4,065 cells:

| room | p5 area | p5 short side | median area |
|---|---|---|---|
| `closet` | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| `bathroom` | 4 | **2** | 6 |
| `bedroom` | 9 | **3** | 14 |
| `kitchen` | 9 | **3** | 21 |
| `livingroom` | 16 | **4** | 32 |
| `diningroom` | 15 | 3 | 20 |
| `garage` | 25 | 5 | 30 |

**A bedroom is 3×3 minimum** — exactly the owner's stated 10ft × 10ft. A
bathroom is 2 on the short side. A livingroom will not go below 4 wide.

**Smallest house containing each room**, which is when the generator should
start adding it: livingroom, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom all at **30
squares** — so a 30 m² house has all four, confirming they are required rather
than optional. Then `laundry` 47, `closet` 48, `diningroom` 64, `office` 66,
`garagestorage` 69, `garage` 78.

### The layout algorithm — the aspect fix, which works

Rooms were coming out as strips: kitchen 15×3, closet 2×7, bathroom 2×10, worst
aspect 7.0. `split` always cut the longer side, which is right for a balanced
split and wrong for an unbalanced one.

**Trying both axes and keeping the better worst-case aspect** takes it to 4.0,
and a 12×10 house to 2.0 on every room. One extra arithmetic per split.

Weights also became §34's **measured median areas** rather than ratios to the
building mean — same ordering, proportions closer to what vanilla builds.

### WHAT IS NOT FINISHED — read this before continuing

**1. The room-list rule is mid-rewrite and wrong.** The owner's rule is:

> livingroom, kitchen, bathroom and at least one bedroom are REQUIRED and have
> minimum sizes. Further bedrooms are added until the space runs out. Closets,
> laundry and storage are the LEFTOVER, not peers with targets. If a room falls
> just short of its minimum, take the slack from a neighbour rather than
> shipping it undersized.

A prototype of that produced:

```
  76 sq ->  4 rooms   beds=1 baths=1
 122 sq ->  9 rooms   beds=3 baths=3     <- three bathrooms
 341 sq -> 13 rooms   beds=4 baths=4     <- same as a 173 sq house, 47% filled
```

Two defects, both plain: **bathrooms scale with bedrooms** when vanilla has
about one per house at these sizes, and the list **stops growing past ~173
squares**, so a 500 m² house gets the same 13 rooms at 32% fill. Do not ship
this. The measured minimums above are correct; the loop that consumes them is
not.

**2. `plan` still bands the core across the full frontage.** The aspect fix
reaches the secondary rooms inside the middle band but not the front and back
bands themselves. The self-test catches it: `NORTH 30x6 livingroom[0,0 30x2]`,
aspect **15.0**, and the suite fails on exactly that case. A 30×6 footprint is
rare and none of our seven are that shape, but the check is red and should stay
red until the core is placed as a block with a secondary room beside it rather
than as a strip.

**3. The elastic resize is unimplemented.** "If you need two more feet to make
the bedrooms 10×10, extend that part of the house" — nothing does this. Rooms
land wherever the partition puts them.

**4. Multi-storey is unimplemented and out of scope.** The owner's rules for it
are recorded and not built: half or more of the bedrooms upstairs, one bedroom
or office down, a bathroom on every floor. Nothing writes at z=1 and stairs do
not exist.

### Measurement caveats worth carrying

**The core-share numbers are unusable.** `RoomMinimums` reported 82.9% core at
≤50 squares, then 67.9, 65.7, 41.7, then **93.0% at 221–350** with a bedroom
median of 0 — non-monotonic and incoherent. Two causes: clustering merges
terraces and apartment blocks into one "house", and we read ground floor only,
so a two-storey house shows its livingroom and kitchen and none of its
bedrooms. **Use the per-room minimums, which are immune to this; ignore the
core share.**

The owner's "core is 25% of the house" does not need measuring anyway — under
the minimums rule it falls out. A small house is mostly livingroom and kitchen
because those hold their size while the bedroom count falls to one.

### OPEN

1. The room-list loop above.
2. Core placed as a block, not a band.
3. Elastic resize.
4. `CellRenderer` cannot show interiors — every wall is drawn at full height
   with no cutaway, so the rooms are occluded. Teaching it to draw walls at
   half height would make floor plans legible in a PNG, which matters because
   we will be looking at a lot of them.
5. `intDoorN` resolves to `walls_interior_house_01_107` while `intDoorW` is
   `_10` — the property test sorts alphabetically and `_107` beats `_11`, so a
   north and west door in the same wall are different styles. Pair doors to
   their block.
6. **The in-game test has not been run.** The doors exist in the data; nobody
   has walked through one.

### C1 DONE + C2 UNDERWAY — application layer begun (2026-08-21)

The port is complete (14 library units, all verified byte-identical against the
Java tree). The application layer has now started.

**C1 — architecture decision: DONE.** C1_ARCHITECTURE.md committed. Five
decisions, each with a falsifier: Qt6 Widgets + OpenGL 4.6 (UI-toolkit fit, not
measured performance); instanced draw + two-tier LOD with a MANDATORY 500k-
instance-at-1440p harness before any viewport code; the game's own
.lotpack/.lotheader files ARE the working store (no DB, flush on save, LRU
evict); in-memory per-session undo; one process. CHUNKS C1 ticked [x].

**C2 — working store + first UI slice: DONE and running on real data.**

MapProject (library, Qt-free, 36 tests):
- Enumerates cells from a map dir; a cell counts only if BOTH X_Y.lotheader and
  world_X_Y.lotpack exist (orphan files ignored).
- LRU cache with a cap; clean cells evict LRU-first, DIRTY CELLS ARE NEVER
  EVICTED (evicting one would silently drop unsaved edits).
- Atomic save: write to <file>.tmp then rename, so a crash mid-write cannot
  corrupt the existing map file (C2 "crash safety").
- Verified: edit through CellEditor → markDirty → save → reopen from scratch →
  edit present on disk. saveAll flushes every dirty cell.

MainWindow (Qt6 app):
- File → Open Map… (Qt's own dialog with DontUseNativeDialog — the KDE Wayland
  portal fails silently otherwise), cell-list dock, load-on-click showing room
  count / non-empty squares / level range, status bar with resident+dirty count.
- Recent Maps: File → Open Recent, last 10 map dirs, QSettings-persisted to
  ~/.config/PZMapMaker, de-duped, most-recent-first, with Clear Recent.
- menuBar()->setNativeMenuBar(false) forces the menu into the window; a toolbar
  (Open Map…/Save Cell) backs it up. Both needed on KDE, which otherwise hoists
  or hides the menu bar.
- VERIFIED on real Muldraugh: opened the map dir, cell list populated (0_18…
  4065 cells), clicked cells and saw correct room counts on building cells,
  16384 non-empty squares on wilderness cells (128×128, correct).

Library stays Qt-free: libpzformat.a has zero Qt. Only the app target links Qt6.
CMake uses find_package(Qt6 ... QUIET) so library + 10 test suites build with or
without Qt; the app builds when Qt is present.

**C3 — viewport: UNBLOCKED but GATED.** Do not write the QOpenGLWidget shell
until the 500k-instance-at-1440p harness is built and confirmed <4ms (C1 §1.2).
The one falsification action outstanding before rendering.

**Remaining C2 polish:** cell-search/jump box (4065 cells is a lot to scroll),
a dirty marker in the cell list, and a close-with-unsaved-changes guard on the
main window (confirmDiscardIfDirty exists and is used on open; wire it to
closeEvent too).

### Build/run notes (bit us, recorded so they don't again)
- Files copied to disk sometimes land EMPTY (main.cpp, .gitignore both hit this).
  ALWAYS `wc -l` a dropped file before building. Reliable in-place write:
  fish `cat > file <<'END_OF_FILE' … END_OF_FILE`.
- Stale build: if a rebuilt binary shows old behaviour, check the RIGHT file
  changed (`grep -c "old string" file`), then `rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B
  build -G Ninja && cmake --build build`.
- The binary is build/pzmapmaker; fish needs `./build/pzmapmaker` (the ./).
- Muldraugh map dir on this machine:
  ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid/media/maps/Muldraugh, KY
  media dir (for TileIndex/atlas): .../projectzomboid/media

### Handoff — SUPERSEDED (was: C2 begun; options C2-polish / harness / SpriteJoin). Current handoff is at end of file.

### C2 polish — cell-search, dirty markers, close guard (2026-08-22)

All three remaining C2 items are implemented. C2 is DONE.

**Cell-search box.** A QLineEdit sits above the QListWidget in the Cells dock.
Substring filter as the user types — items whose cell name doesn't match are
hidden via QListWidgetItem::setHidden. Enter in the search box loads the first
visible match (jumpToFirstMatch). Ctrl+G (File → Go to Cell…) focuses and
selects the search box. Clearing the field shows all cells again
(setClearButtonEnabled).

**Dirty marker in cell list.** refreshDirtyMarkers() walks the list widget and
sets bold font + " *" suffix on any cell in project_->dirtyCells(). Called
after populateCellList, saveCurrent, and saveAll. Dirty state is read from the
CellCoord stored in Qt::UserRole, not from the display text, so the marker
never interferes with cell identification.

**Close-with-unsaved guard.** closeEvent overridden; delegates to the existing
confirmDiscardIfDirty(). event->ignore() if the user cancels, event->accept()
otherwise. Same guard that openMap and openRecent already use.

**Not changed:** CMakeLists.txt, library code, tests. Only app/mainwindow.hpp
and app/mainwindow.cpp were touched.

### Handoff — SUPERSEDED (was: C2 done; options harness / SpriteJoin). Current handoff is at end of file.

### C3 render gate MEASURED — instanced draw confirmed, C1 §1.2 threshold corrected (2026-08-22)

The C1 §1.2 falsifier (the one action outstanding before any C3 viewport code)
is resolved. Full write-up: harness/FINDINGS_harness_2026-08-22.md. Summary:

**The gate PASSES for instanced draw, and its threshold was mis-specified.**
Built harness/instance_harness.cpp (throwaway, no project code): N instances,
one glDrawElementsInstanced, 1440p FBO, alpha-blended, texture-array sampled,
GL_TIME_ELAPSED median over 300 frames, vsync off. RTX 3070 Ti, GL 4.5 core.

Measured (500k instances unless noted, median GPU ms):
- 3px sprite,   4.5M frag,  1.2x overdraw: 0.655 ms
- 9px sprite,  40.5M frag, 11.0x overdraw: 2.543 ms
- 18px sprite,162.0M frag, 43.9x overdraw: 4.814 ms
- 18px, blend OFF, same frag:              4.221 ms
- 200k @ 18px, 64.8M frag, 17.6x:          1.903 ms  (C1's predicted 1:1 load) PASS
- 1M   @ 18px,324.0M frag, 87.7x:          9.634 ms  (linear vs 500k)

CONFIRMED (measured):
- Instancing has no draw-call cliff: 500k->1M is linear. One instanced draw of
  a million instances is fine. C1's "naive per-sprite draw dies" was about
  per-sprite DRAW CALLS, not instanced draw.
- The bound is FILL (fragments on screen), not instance count. 500k instances
  at near-zero fill = 0.655ms (~1.3ns/inst floor); holding count fixed and only
  growing sprite size took it to 4.814ms (7.3x). The 500k FAIL at 18px is a 44x
  overdraw artifact of full-surface scatter, not an instancing limit.
- Blending is minor: 0.59ms of 4.81 (12%). Dominant cost is shaded-fragment
  throughput. (Refutes an earlier working guess that blend RMW was the lever.)
- C1's actual predicted 1:1 load (150-200k inst) passes at 1.9ms.

CORRECTION to C1 §1.2:
- Old: "500k instances <4ms or instanced draw is wrong; fall back to chunked
  merged geometry."
- Actual: the 500k-<4ms gate conflated instance count and overdraw into one
  number. Instanced draw is VIABLE; the fill ceiling at 44x overdraw is what
  fails, and the named fallback would NOT have helped (it cuts draw-call/vertex
  work while this is fragment-bound). The harness earned its cost by ruling out
  the wrong fallback before it was built.

UNVERIFIED / imperfect:
- The fill curve is concave (saturating), not linear: the 9px point is 0.94ms
  above a line through 3px and 18px. Three points don't justify a fitted law;
  the table is the datum. Sweep 3-24px to pin it.
- Real viewport overdraw is NOT known to be below the harness's. A dense PZ cell
  (8 z-levels, blended back-to-front) could approach it. The 200k PASS is the
  COUNT C1 predicted; the harness can't measure real OVERDRAW. First C3 task:
  decode one real dense cell to instances and read its on-screen fragment count.

CONSEQUENCE for C3 (the bound is fragments, so overdraw control is the work):
- Opaque pre-pass (front-to-back, depth write) for opaque ground/floor tiles;
  only translucent sprites take the blended back-to-front pass. Biggest lever.
- Tier-2 LOD crossover is load-bearing, not polish: must fire before on-screen
  fragment count exceeds fill budget. Choose the crossover against measured
  fill, not the assumed 1:32-1:64.

Instanced draw stands. The QOpenGLWidget/QOpenGLWindow shell may proceed on that
path. C3 is now truly unblocked (gate cleared), not merely "unblocked, gated".

### C3 step 1 — GL shell live + dense-cell census MEASURED (2026-08-23)

Delivered: app/mapview.hpp, app/mapview.cpp wired into MainWindow via a
QStackedWidget (placeholder index 0, GL viewport index 1). On first cell load
the stack switches to the GL surface. QOpenGLWindow in createWindowContainer —
NOT QOpenGLWidget, per C1 §1.2 line 60 (Wayland copy-path avoidance). Context
comes up clean on Garuda/KDE/Wayland, no XWayland fallback, no errors.

MEASURED — dense downtown cell 43_26, Muldraugh, Build 42 (256x256, 3 levels):
  instances:     135,635
  non-empty sq:   70,688  (2.07 tiles/square avg)
  levels:         0..2

Fragment estimate (bounding 64x32 quad, 0.5 diamond-alpha factor — both
assumed, not measured; instance count is exact):
  whole cell drawn: ~139M drawn fragments = ~38x overdraw on 2560x1440
  at 1:1 (~2.7% of cell on screen): ~3,700 instances, ~3.8M frag, ~1x overdraw

WHAT THIS CONFIRMS:
1. At 1:1 zoom (the editing view) the viewport is trivially safe. ~1x overdraw
   at normal editing zoom. Enormous headroom. No optimisation needed there.
2. Zoomed-out whole-cell view is the fill risk, not 1:1. 135k instances is well
   under the harness's ~415k instance ceiling, but whole-cell drawn at once is
   ~38x overdraw (~139M frag) — by the harness's 44x→4.8ms reference, ~4.1ms
   for one cell at full zoom. Over budget, and the editor will show multiple
   cells when zoomed out.
3. Instance count is a non-issue for real cells. The risk is fragments/overdraw
   at low zoom. This confirms and sharpens the harness finding.

CALIBRATION TARGET FOR LOD (now concrete, was "1:32-1:64 assumed"):
  LOD must fire before on-screen drawn fragments approach the fill budget.
  Per the harness, fill budget ≈ 415k blended 18px-equivalent fragments.
  Per the census, whole 43_26 at 1:1 = ~139M drawn frag.
  LOD crossover needed before zoom-out brings >~3x the 1:1 on-screen tile size,
  i.e. well before the whole cell is visible at full resolution.
  Exact crossover zoom should be measured against the real tile draw (step 2),
  not estimated from these bounding-quad numbers.

HONESTY NOTE — what is exact vs assumed:
  EXACT: instance count (135,635), square count (70,688), level range (0..2).
         These are a direct walk of the tile data via CellData::tilesAt().
  ASSUMED: kSpriteFragments = 64x32 = 2048px bounding quad; 0.5 diamond factor.
           Fragment/overdraw numbers are ±2x until real textured tiles are drawn
           and the actual fragment cost is GPU-timed. That is step 2's job.

NEXT STEP (C3 step 2):
  Build the textured tile draw with the opaque pre-pass from the start:
  - Pass 1: opaque tiles, front-to-back, depth write ON. Early-Z kills most
    overdraw before it reaches the fragment shader. Biggest fill lever.
  - Pass 2: translucent tiles only, back-to-front, depth write OFF.
  GPU-time both passes on 43_26 and record real fragment cost. This replaces
  the bounding-quad estimate above with a measured number.
  Atlas step deferred: use a 1x1 white texture per tile type initially so the
  draw call structure and timing are real without needing the atlas ported first.

### C3 step 2 — textured two-pass draw MEASURED + QOpenGLWindow retracted (2026-08-23)

Delivered: MapView now does the real two-pass instanced draw. Opaque floors
first (depth write, front-to-back, early-Z), then translucent (walls/objects/
vegetation) blended back-to-front. Placeholder atlas: 1x1 solid tint per tile
name (real atlas is a later step); draw-call structure and GPU timing are real.
Per-pass GL_TIME_ELAPSED timing. Cell renders correctly on Garuda/Wayland.

MEASURED (43_46, whole cell fit-to-window ~940px, 99,830 instances):
  opaque      72,294 inst: ~0.28ms   (floors, depth-write pass)
  translucent 27,536 inst: ~0.14ms   (blended pass)
  total:                   ~0.4ms    (range 0.24-0.60 across frames)

This supersedes the step-1 census ESTIMATE (~4.1ms whole-cell, bounding-quad
guess): the estimate was ~8x too high. Real fill at this zoom is ~0.4ms — huge
headroom under the 4ms budget. Opaque/translucent per-instance cost is ~4.6 vs
~5.1 ns/inst; the blended pass is ~1.1x costlier per instance, as expected.

IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMIT (unmeasured case): this is the whole cell FIT TO WINDOW,
i.e. every tile shrunk to ~3px, so fragment count is capped by the window, not
the cell. It is the cheap zoomed-OUT case. The expensive case — whole cell at
full 1:1 with real per-tile overdraw stacking — needs pan/zoom and is NOT yet
measured. That measurement belongs to step 3. Do not read 0.4ms as the 1:1 cost.

CORRECTION — QOpenGLWindow path RETRACTED (C1 §1.2 line 60 was wrong for this
platform):
  C1 §1.2 said use QOpenGLWindow-in-createWindowContainer because QOpenGLWidget
  has "a copy path that kills frame time" on Wayland. On this Garuda/KDE/Wayland
  setup the OPPOSITE held: QOpenGLWindow-in-container rendered NOTHING VISIBLE.
  Draws executed (timed, zero GL errors, geometry on-screen per CPU projection),
  but the container's native surface and the GL context surface diverged —
  readback of the draw target (draw_fbo=0) returned all-zero including the clear
  colour. Nothing was ever presented.
  Switching to QOpenGLWidget fixed it immediately: draw_fbo=1 (Qt's managed FBO),
  readback returned drawn pixels, cell visible. Measured cost ~0.4ms — the
  "copy path that kills frame time" is not killing anything here. The C1 claim
  was an unmeasured assumption; it is now falsified for this platform and
  QOpenGLWidget is the confirmed path. (If the copy cost ever bites at higher
  zoom/resolution, revisit WITH NUMBERS, not assumptions.)

HOW IT WAS FOUND (method note): three wrong guesses (baseInstance null-ptr,
projection off-screen, depth-clear rejection) were each disproven by
instrumentation rather than argued about. The decisive tools were glGetError
(clean), a CPU-side projection print (geometry on-screen), and glReadPixels of
the draw target (all-zero incl. clear -> wrong surface -> the FBO/present path,
not the render code). Real fixes that survived: depth mapped to a safe [0.2,0.8]
interior range (the old ~1.0 depths were rejected against the depth-clear of 1.0,
blanking the opaque pass), and fit-to-window scale so the 16384px-wide cell fits
a ~940px viewport.

### C3 step 3 — interactive pan/zoom + 1:1 overdraw MEASURED (2026-08-23)

Delivered: wheel zoom (cursor-anchored), left-drag pan, F to re-frame, 1 to jump
to exact 1:1. Camera state zoom_/panX_/panY_, seeded by fitToWindow() on load.

MEASURED — 1:1 zoom, cell 43_46, 99,830 instances: ~0.4-0.5ms total (opaque
~0.33ms, translucent ~0.16ms) — same band as fit-to-window.

ALL FILL CASES COVERED. Bounded from two sides: zoomed out, tiles shrink;
zoomed in, only ~2.7% of the cell is visible. Both ~0.4ms. The expensive case
(all tiles at full size) is unreachable in a single-cell viewport at any zoom.

CONSEQUENCE for LOD: the step-1 census called Tier-2 LOD "load-bearing" on a
~4.1ms whole-cell estimate (bounding-quad, since retracted). Measured fill at
every reachable zoom is ~0.4ms — 10x under budget. LOD is NOT needed for
single-cell editing. It remains warranted only for a multi-cell world-overview
mode (C4/C5). The step-1 LOD-crossover calibration item is CLOSED for C3.

### C3 step 4a — sprite atlas bridge working (2026-08-23)

The library->pixels bridge for real tile sprites works. New app-layer SpriteAtlas
(app/spriteatlas.hpp/.cpp): indexes every .pack via ported PackFile (entry tables
only), then buildLayers() decodes just the pages a cell needs via QImage and blits
each sprite's rect. Library stays dependency-free; QImage decodes PNG in the app
layer only. File -> Set Texturepacks... picks the dir (defaults to Steam path).

MEASURED on real install + cell 43_46:
  indexed 46,540 sprite names from 24/24 packs  (matches oracle count exactly —
    PackFile decode + name indexing confirmed on the full retail set)
  built 114 layers, 10 missing  (104/114 cell tile names resolved to real pixels)

The 10 missing are the "authored tile with no atlas sprite" case flagged during
the port (STATE ~line 116-123). buildLayers now prints each MISSING name so they
can be checked against that known set, not assumed. The renderer must
substitute/flag, not crash — the independent check the port predicted.

Texturepacks path (doubled projectzomboid segment is real, B42):
  ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid/media/texturepacks

### C3 step 4b — real sprite art rendering (2026-08-23)

The viewport now draws actual PZ tile art. uploadSpriteAtlas() sizes the
GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY to the cell's max sprite dims (126x144 for 43_46), blits each
sprite bottom-left, and stores per-layer (uvW,uvH,ox,oy) in an Nx1 RGBA32F meta
texture sampled by layer index. Vertex shader sizes each quad to the sprite's
real pixel w*h (uv*uAtlasDims), places it at the iso anchor with the entry ox/oy
offset, bottom-centre aligned. Fragment shader alpha-tests in the opaque pass
(transparent sprite pixels must not punch depth holes) and blends in the
translucent pass.

VERIFIED visually on 43_46: grass, foliage, paved road, sidewalk, sand ground
all render as real art in correct iso position. Zoomed in, tiles sit right.
Performance holds ~0.3-0.5ms (first-frame atlas upload is a one-time ~7ms spike).

Missing-sprite handling: the 10 no-sprite vegetation tiles render as small
(16x16) semi-transparent magenta markers — flagged, not hidden. First attempt
filled the whole 126x144 layer opaque magenta, which (with tens of thousands of
vegetation instances) blanketed the map; the small-marker fix cleared it.

Known cosmetic gaps (NOT bugs, deferred):
- Tree/groundcover species substitution (STATE §11) not done — those tiles have
  no direct atlas sprite by design; markers show where they are.
- Depth ordering between overlapping sprites may have minor quirks at some zooms;
  not obviously broken. Revisit if editing needs precise pick order.

### C3 step 5 — level selector + downtown verification + layer-cap limit (2026-08-23)

Level selector (Model B) done and VERIFIED. QSpinBox in the status bar + keys
([ ] step, 0-7 direct) show all tiles with z <= chosen level. Shader discards
z > uMaxLevel. Two-way synced with the view; range auto-matches the cell's
[minLevel,maxLevel]; grays out on single-level cells. Verified on the KNOX BANK
in 41_37: level 1 shows the furnished ground floor (desks, ATM, counter), level
2 shows the upper structure — floor peeling works.

Also this session: default view is now 1:1 centred on the cell (readable) not
fit-to-window confetti (F still gives the whole-cell overview); missing sprites
render invisible not magenta markers; texturepacks path persists via QSettings
and auto-loads on startup (no more re-picking).

Verified the renderer on real geometry: 43_46 is rural (content census:
blends_natural=68k, walls=0, floors=0 — correctly all grass/trees/road, not a
bug). 41_37 is downtown (floors=8912 walls=8035 roofs=3779, levels -1..4) and
renders as a full furnished residential+commercial block. The renderer was never
broken; earlier "black" cells were either rural or the layer-cap bug below.

KNOWN LIMITATION — texture-array layer cap (the real remaining C3 issue):
  The atlas is one GL texture-array layer per distinct sprite. A downtown cell
  uses ~3972 distinct sprites, but GL_MAX_ARRAY_TEXTURE_LAYERS is 2048 (NVIDIA).
  glTexImage3D failed with GL_INVALID_VALUE -> blank atlas -> near-black render.
  DIAGNOSED via a post-alloc glGetError guard (prints the GB + error instead of
  silently going black) — it was layer COUNT, not memory (0.8 GB was fine).
  INTERIM FIX: query the cap, clamp storage to it, skip blitting past it, shader
  discards sprites with layer >= uLayerCount. Result: most of a dense cell
  renders; sprites past 2048 are blank (visible as dark patches on 41_37).
  Also cap individual sprite size at 256px (one 744x982 jumbo sprite sizes every
  layer, so downscale oversized sprites in SpriteAtlas via QImage first).
  PROPER FIX (own step, next): atlas PACKING — pack many sprites into each 2D
  layer of a small array (e.g. 4096x4096 pages) instead of one-per-layer. This
  removes the layer wall entirely and is the right long-term design.

Perf note: first frame after a cell load spikes (~390ms on 41_37) — the atlas
upload (decode+scale ~4000 PNGs) blocks the render thread. One-time per cell;
steady-state is 0.2-1.7ms. Fine for now; async upload later if it annoys.

### C3 polish — pan fix + sprite projection corrected from PZ source (2026-08-23)

PAN BUG (post-pan tiles vanishing):
  After panning, nearly all tiles (floors, roads, walls) vanished; only
  translucent-pass tiles (grass, trees) survived. Resize fixed it; F did not.
  The surviving tiles were exactly the depth-test-OFF pass; the vanishing ones
  were the depth-test-ON (opaque) pass — conclusive. The depth buffer on
  QOpenGLWidget's FBO on this Wayland setup was not clearing/persisting
  correctly between paints that didn't involve a resize. Fix: disable depth test
  in both passes and rely on painter's order (opaque first, then translucent).
  The two-pass structure + alpha-test discard handles layering correctly without
  depth. Also added glViewport() at the top of every paintGL() — QOpenGLWidget
  on Wayland did not reliably preserve the GL viewport between paint calls.

SPRITE PROJECTION CORRECTED (fence stagger, slide in two pieces):
  The iso transform was guessed, not sourced. Decompiled IsoUtils.java from the
  B42 jar gave the exact PZ calculation:
    XToScreen: sx = (x - y) * 32      -- was correct
    YToScreen: sy = (x + y) * 16 - z * 96  -- z factor was wrong (had 48)
  And IsoSprite.prepareToRenderSprite gave the anchor:
    sprite top-left = (ax - 32 + ox, ay - 96 + oy)
  where ox/oy are the pack entry offsets. The old anchor was "bottom-centre"
  (invented, not sourced), which misplaced every tall sprite independently.
  Both values are now exact from the decompiled source. Fences align; multi-tile
  objects (slides, walls) connect correctly.
  METHOD NOTE: PZMapCreation (the Java oracle) never implemented rendering, so
  there was no oracle for sprite placement. The right source was the decompiled
  PZ game binary directly (IsoUtils.class, IsoSprite.class from the B42 jar).
  This is the correct approach for any future rendering questions.

### Status pointer — 2026-08-23 (live, not a handoff)
Port: DONE. C1: DONE (corrected). C2: DONE.
C3: COMPLETE as a viewer. Real PZ art with correct sprite placement, pan/zoom,
  level selector, persistent texturepacks, readable 1:1 default. One known
  limitation: 2048-layer array cap blanks some sprites on dense cells (interim
  clamp; proper fix = atlas packing).
NEXT, choose:
  (a) Atlas packing — remove the layer cap. Pure rendering-quality work.
  (b) C4 — picking/editing: click a tile, see/change it. Turns viewer to editor.


### C4 picking — click-to-identify DONE (2026-08-25)

The read side of C4 is complete and verified. The write side (tile replacement,
brushes, undo UI) is next and depends on A3.

**What was built (app layer only, no library changes):**

`MapView` — picking subsystem:
- `screenToTile(cx, cy)` — inverse of the PZ iso transform (IsoUtils.java,
  sourced from the decompiled B42 jar). At z=0 ground plane:
    wx = (ax/32 + ay/16) / 2,  wy = (ay/16 - ax/32) / 2
  where ax/ay = (screen - pan) / zoom. Returns cell-local (tx, ty) or (-1,-1)
  outside the cell.
- `squareTiles_` — flat CPU-side retention of every tile index per (x,y,z),
  filled during `buildInstances`. Enables picking without retaining the
  full CellData pointer.
- `cellTileNames_` — mirrors `cell.header().tileNames` for name resolution.
- `tileClicked(int tx, int ty, QVector<QPair<int,QString>> tiles)` signal —
  emitted on left-click (not drag; 3px threshold). Carries (z, name) pairs
  in painter's order, low z first.
- `setMouseTracking(true)` in constructor — required for mouseMoveEvent to
  fire without a button held. Missing this caused hover to only work during
  drags.

`MapView` — hover and selection overlays:
- A second minimal GL program (`overlayProg_`, `overlayVao_`, `overlayVbo_`)
  draws coloured `GL_LINE_LOOP` diamonds. Separate from the sprite shader;
  4 pre-projected NDC vertices uploaded per frame via `glBufferSubData`.
- `hoverTile_` — updated in `mouseMoveEvent` (every move, not just drags).
  Cleared in `leaveEvent`. Yellow diamond.
- `selectedTile_` — set on click, persists until next click. Cyan diamond,
  drawn before hover so yellow sits on top when both occupy the same square.
- `glLineWidth(2.0f)` is illegal in GL 4.5 core profile and was removed.
  Line width stays at 1.

`MainWindow`:
- `TileIndex tiles_` — loaded from `$PZ/media` when texturepacks are
  indexed. Path derived by stripping trailing slash from the texturepacks
  dir and calling `parent_path()`. B42 puts `.tiles` files directly in
  `media/` (no subdirectory); `TileIndex::load` scans for `*.tiles` there.
  Confirmed: 61,418 tiles loaded on startup.
- `tileClicked` lambda — formats the Tile Info dock: coordinate header, then
  for each z-level a `z = N` header, indented tile name, and doubly-indented
  properties (`key` or `key = value`).
- Tile Info dock — `QTextEdit`, read-only, monospace 9pt, right dock area.

**CONFIRMED (verified in the running app):**
- `screenToTile` is accurate: clicking a tile whose name is visible in the
  viewport returns the correct (tx, ty) and the Tile Info panel shows the
  expected tile names and properties.
- Hover diamond tracks the cursor continuously and disappears on leave.
- Selection (cyan) persists across mouse moves; yellow hover sits on top.
- z-level grouping is correct: a doorway square showed floor (z=0), interior
  walls, door frame, door, then ceiling and roof (z=1) in the correct order.
- Property display is correct: `blends_natural_01_38` showed `FloorMaterial
  = Grass_Medium`, `grassFloor`, `solidfloor`, etc. matching known tile data.

**OPEN (not bugs, deferred):**
- `GL_INVALID_OPERATION` (0x0501) fires every frame during hover/selection
  draw. Source is not yet identified — `glLineWidth` was the known cause and
  was removed; a second call site may exist elsewhere in the overlay path, or
  it may be a uniform or VAO state issue. Does not affect correctness; fix
  before errors become noise that hides real problems.
- `selectedTile_` is not cleared when a new cell is loaded. After loading a
  different cell, the cyan diamond may appear at stale coordinates. Fix:
  call `selectedTile_ = {-1,-1}` in `clearCell()` and at the top of
  `setCell()`.

**NEXT:** C4 write side — tile replacement through `CellEditor`. Depends on
A3-pre1 and A3-pre2 (wall joining prerequisites) per CHUNKS.md, but a
simpler first step is floor replacement (no wall-join logic needed) to
prove the edit → dirty → save → reload loop works end-to-end in the UI.

### C4 write side — floor replacement DONE (2026-08-25)

First real editing action works end to end: click a tile, type a floor name,
Set Floor -> CellEditor::setFloor -> markDirty -> refreshCell. Verified in-app on
41_37 (downtown). Ctrl+S saves; reload from disk confirms persistence.

**What was built:**
- Tile Info dock gained a write row: QLineEdit (tile name) + "Set Floor" button.
- Set Floor handler in MainWindow: validates the name against TileIndex, reads
  the target z from the level spinbox (working level == view level, as intended),
  calls `lc.editor->setFloor(tx, ty, z, name)`, marks the cell dirty, and
  refreshes the viewport.
- `MapView::refreshCell(cell)` — NEW. Rebuilds instances + picking data from
  edited cell data WITHOUT touching zoom/pan/level or re-framing. This is the
  edit path; `setCell` remains the load path (which does re-frame). Fixes the
  camera-recenter-on-edit bug.
- `MapView::clearSelection()` — clears the cyan selection diamond; called on
  cell load so selection doesn't persist across cells (the deferred C4 item).
- Working level now persists via QSettings("workingLevel"): the spinbox no
  longer jumps to the cell's max on every load. It restores the last-used level,
  clamped to the new cell's [min,max]. Fixes "always opens on level 4".

**Sprite atlas rebuild on edit — conditional, and why:**
`CellData::tileIndex(name)` appends a new name to tileNames if not present,
giving it a new index past the atlas layers built at load. So an edit that
introduces a genuinely new name needs a sprite-layer rebuild. BUT rebuilding
unconditionally re-packs the layer array, and on a cell exceeding the 2048
GPU layer cap the re-pack shuffles which sprite shows on layers past the cap,
making unrelated squares appear to change. Fix: rebuild ONLY when
`tileNames.size()` actually grew (namesAfter != namesBefore). In the normal
workflow (painting a tile the cell already contains) there is no rebuild and
the edit is instant. The residual case (new name on a cap-exceeding cell) is
the 2048-cap limitation, whose real fix is atlas packing (own chunk).

**IMPORTANT non-bug — multi-tile floor sprites:**
Spent a while chasing a "paints 4 tiles instead of 1" report. It is NOT a bug.
Proven by dumping the 3x3 data block after each edit: the DATA always changed
exactly one square (setFloor is correct; CellData::setSquare writes one slot).
The visual "4 tiles" comes from sprites whose logical tile size (fx,fy) exceeds
64x128 — e.g. some "Beige Checkered Tiles" floors are 2x2-block sprites whose
art covers a 2x2 area. Painting one square with such a sprite shows art over
four tile positions. Confirmed by printing sprite metadata:
  floors_interior_tilesandwood_01_21: w=63 h=32 fx=64 fy=128 -> single tile,
    paints one square (correct).
  floors_interior_tilesandwood_01_54 / _35: larger sprites -> art spans 2x2.
The shader already places sprites by per-sprite (ox,oy,fx,fy) from PZ's
prepareToRenderSprite, so this matches how PZ itself renders. TAKEAWAY for the
tool palette: floors are not all 1x1; palette thumbnails must show the sprite's
real extent so the user knows whether a tile is single or block-spanning.

**Palette preload — the planned next step (design settled, not yet built):**
The paint workflow should draw from a fixed tool palette of paintable tiles,
loaded into the atlas UP FRONT. Then painting never grows the atlas, never
rebuilds, never shuffles. Constraints worked out this session:
- Cannot load all 46,540 pack sprites: at 197x256 RGBA8 (~200KB/layer) that is
  ~9.3 GB and 22x over the 2048-layer cap. Not viable as one-per-layer.
- Palette-scoped preload IS viable: a floor palette is a few hundred sprites
  (tens of MB, well under the cap). Load the palette's sprites at startup on
  top of the cell's own layers. This is the smallest correct fix for editing.
- The general fix remains atlas PACKING (many sprites per 4096x4096 page: a
  197x256 sprite packs ~320/page, so 46,540 sprites -> ~146 pages, trivially
  under any cap). Packing removes the layer wall for both viewing and editing
  and is the right long-term design. LRU paging sits on top of packing if the
  full tileset is ever needed resident at once.

**Still open (deferred, not blocking):**
- GL_INVALID_OPERATION (0x0501) per-frame: FIXED earlier by removing
  glLineWidth (core profile). Confirmed gone.
- setSquare/setFloor only handle floors so far. setWall/removeWall/addObject
  exist in CellEditor but have no UI yet. Next editing actions.
- Undo/redo: CellEditor has the journal; no UI binding yet (Ctrl+Z/Y).

**NEXT:** either (a) build the tool palette + palette-preload atlas so painting
is a first-class action with a picker, or (b) wire more CellEditor ops (walls,
objects, undo) to the UI. (a) is the higher-value path toward a usable editor.

### Design note — tile footprint preview (2026-08-25)

**Idea (owner):** when a tile name is loaded in the Set Floor edit box, the
viewport's cyan selection diamond should expand to show the actual footprint
of that sprite BEFORE the user clicks Set Floor. If the tile is a 2×2 block
sprite, the outline covers 4 squares. This warns the user they are about to
overpaint more than the single square they designated.

**Why this matters:** confirmed this session that some floor sprites are
multi-tile (e.g. `floors_interior_tilesandwood_01_54` covers a 2×2 area).
Painting one square with such a tile visually changes 4 squares — the data
is correct (one square changed) but the art spills over. Without a footprint
preview, the user has no way to know the tile they are about to place will
cover more than the selected square.

**How to implement:** the metadata is already available.
`SpriteAtlas::Layer` carries `fx, fy` (logical tile size). A single-tile
floor is `fx=64, fy=128`. Tile span = `fx/64` wide × `fy/128` deep. To get
this without a full PNG decode: `atlas_.buildLayers({name})` on a single name
is fast (just metadata lookup for the entry dimensions) — or better, add a
`SpriteAtlas::queryMeta(name) -> Layer` that reads the pack entry dimensions
without decoding pixels (pack entries carry w/h/ox/oy/fx/fy already in the
entry table; no decode needed).

**Viewport change:** `drawHoverOverlay` currently draws a fixed single-tile
diamond. Change it to accept a footprint size `(tw, td)` (tiles wide, tiles
deep) and draw a parallelogram covering `tw × td` tile positions starting
from the hovered/selected square. For `tw=td=1` this is the existing diamond.

**When to implement:** this is the first item in the palette/tool chunk. It
should ship alongside the tile picker so the footprint preview works for
palette selections, not just typed names. Logging here so it is not forgotten.

### Design note — stamp brush interaction model (2026-08-25)

**Confirmed interaction design** (researched against Tiled, Godot tilemap editor,
Tilesetter, and other industry-standard tile editors — all converge on the same
pattern):

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| Left-click (no brush loaded) | Inspect tile — current behavior |
| Left-click (brush loaded) | Place brush at that square |
| Left-drag (brush loaded) | Paint stroke across multiple squares |
| Right-click any tile in viewport | Pick up floor tile as active stamp brush |
| Middle-drag OR Alt+left-drag | Pan — works in ANY mode, brush or not |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom — unchanged |
| Escape | Clear brush, return to inspect mode |

**Why Alt+drag for pan:** this is the standard that frees left-click entirely
for painting without mode collision. Pan is available at any point during a
paint operation without dropping the brush or switching modes. This directly
satisfies the requirement: pan freely between picking up a material and placing
it, while the brush stays loaded.

**What needs to be built:**
- Brush state object in MapView (active tile name + sprite metadata for
  footprint sizing). Null = inspect mode, non-null = paint mode.
- Right-click in viewport: if tile under cursor has a floor, load it as brush.
  Show the tile name + footprint in the Tile Info dock immediately.
- Alt+left-drag: pan (same math as current left-drag pan, gated on Alt held).
  Current left-drag pan remains as-is when no brush is loaded; Alt+drag is
  the universal pan that works regardless of brush state.
- Left-click while brush loaded: call setFloor at the clicked square, z =
  levelSpin value. Drag threshold (3px, already in code) separates click-place
  from drag-stroke.
- Left-drag while brush loaded: paint stroke — call setFloor on each new square
  entered during the drag (track last-painted square to avoid redundant writes).
- Footprint preview: hover diamond expands to the brush tile's footprint
  (fx/64 wide × fy/128 deep) using the already-designed queryMeta path. This
  is the visual warning for multi-tile sprites (see earlier design note).
- Escape: clear brush, restore inspect mode hover diamond.

**Interaction with existing code:**
- `mousePressEvent`, `mouseMoveEvent`, `mouseReleaseEvent` all need brush-state
  awareness. The 3px drag threshold (pressX_/pressY_) already exists.
- `drawHoverOverlay` already handles the diamond; footprint sizing is additive.
- `setFloor` write path already works; stroke painting calls it per square.
- Middle-drag pan: Qt delivers middle-button events via `Qt::MiddleButton` in
  `mousePressEvent` — same pan math as current left-drag, separate button check.

**NOT yet built. Logged for the palette/tool chunk.**

### C4 stamp brush + pan — DONE (2026-08-25)

Items 1–4 of the stamp brush chunk are complete and verified.

**Middle-drag pan (item 1).** `Qt::MiddleButton` in `mousePressEvent` sets `midDragging_`; `mouseMoveEvent` pans when `midDragging_` is true. Self-contained in `MapView`; no MainWindow change needed.

**Alt+left-drag pan.** `altHeld_` tracked via `keyPressEvent`/`keyReleaseEvent`. Alt+drag pans instead of painting. KDE intercepts Alt+drag at the compositor level as a window-move gesture — confirmed not working on this setup. Kept in code for non-KDE use; Space or Ctrl alternatives not yet tried.

**Brush state + right-click pickup (item 2).** Right-click in the viewport emits `floorPickedUp(name, z)`. `MainWindow` receives it, calls `view_->setBrush(name, atlas)` and syncs the level spinbox to the z where the tile was found. `setBrush` calls `atlas.queryMeta(name)` (metadata-only, no PNG decode) to compute `brushW_ = fx/64`, `brushD_ = fy/128` for footprint sizing.

**Footprint preview (item 3).** `drawHoverOverlay` draws a green `brushW_ × brushD_` parallelogram in brush mode instead of the single yellow diamond. 1×1 for standard floors; expands for multi-tile sprites. Selection diamond hidden while brush is active.

**Left-click/drag to paint (item 4).** In brush mode, left-click emits `paintTile(tx, ty)` on release. Left-drag emits `paintTile` for each new square entered past the 3px threshold. `MainWindow` calls `CellEditor::setFloor` at the spinbox z, marks dirty, refreshes viewport. Escape clears brush and returns to inspect mode.

**Bugs found and fixed during this session:**

- `mainwindow.cpp` connections (`floorPickedUp`, `paintTile`) were not in the binary when the patch was first applied — middle-drag worked (self-contained) but 2-7 silently did nothing. Fixed by delivering full files.
- `Qt::DefaultContextMenu` policy would have intercepted right-click before `mousePressEvent`. Fixed with `setContextMenuPolicy(Qt::NoContextMenu)` in the `MapView` constructor.
- Right-click pickup hardcoded `z_slot=0` (minLevel), but ground-floor tiles are at z=0 game coordinates which is `z_slot = 0 - minLevel`. For this cell (minLevel=-1) the grass was at z_slot=1, so slot 0 was always empty. Fixed by scanning all z_slots from minLevel upward.
- Painting landed 3 squares up-right from the green outline because the level spinbox was at z=1 while pickup found the tile at z=0. Each extra z-level shifts the iso render by ~3 tile-widths visually. Fixed by emitting the found z in `floorPickedUp` and syncing the spinbox on pickup.

**Files changed:** `app/mapview.hpp`, `app/mapview.cpp`, `app/spriteatlas.hpp`, `app/spriteatlas.cpp`, `app/mainwindow.cpp`.

**CHUNKS update:** C4 stamp brush items 1–4 done. Item 5 (tile picker panel) is next within C4.


### C4 brush footprint placement correction — 2026-08-25

A `MapView` update fixed the multi-tile brush placement offset. Previously,
painting a multi-tile material, such as a 4×4 floor sprite, over a 1×1 material
could place the visible art offset from the green footprint preview.

The placement direction is now `+(brushW_-1, brushD_-1)`, matching the preview
box. Verification: rebuilt, picked a 4×4 material, painted where the green box
showed, and checked the `[paint]` log line against the visible result.

**CONFIRMED:** the art lands perfectly in the green footprint box. The preview
and write placement now agree for multi-tile floor brushes.
