# pzformat — AI session handoff

Paste this whole file at the start of a new session. It is the single source of
truth for what this project is, what already exists, what has been proven, and
what comes next. Nothing described here as existing needs to be rebuilt.

---

## Read this first — where to go

| you want | read |
|---|---|
| **What to do next** | the **Handoff** at the very end of this file, and `CHUNKS.md` |
| **What not to waste time on** | **§13 Corrections** — beliefs that turned out wrong |
| **How to verify a port step** | `VERIFY.md` |
| **Why a past decision was made** | `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` |

**`STATE_ARCHIVED.md` exists and you do not need to paste it.** On 2026-09-01
this file reached 5,096 lines and the live facts stopped being findable inside
it. By owner decision, session narrative, superseded models and closed todo
lists were **moved** — not deleted — to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md`. Sections §3, §14,
§15, §17, §18, §21, §23, §24 and the Track C build log now appear here as
numbered stubs pointing there. **Section numbers were kept, so every `(§N)`
reference still resolves.**

Domain knowledge about PZ's formats and engine behaviour was **not** archived,
whatever language it was learned in. Those facts outlive the port.

**The rule that produced the bloat, and the rule that replaces it.** CHARTER §5
makes this file append-only, which is why a wrong belief becomes a Corrections
row rather than an edit. That is still true and still right. What changed is
that *history* no longer has to live in the same file as *current truth*. When
a section stops being something a future session needs, move it — whole,
unedited, with a stub left behind. Do not summarise it away; that is the
2026-08-07 failure CHARTER §5 exists to prevent.

## 1. What this project is

**The goal is a Project Zomboid map editor that is better than the official
tools** (TileZed / WorldEd / the new WorldZed). Build 42, retail 42.20.

It is a Java library plus toolset — no dependencies, Java 21, 224 self-tests.
Solo project, no CI, no code review. Built in three layers, in this order:

1. **Format layer** — read and write every file PZ uses for map data, verified
   byte-for-byte against the full vanilla dataset. **Done and trustworthy.**
2. **Semantic layer** — know what a tile *means* (wall, door, window, container,
   facing) rather than just which sprite it draws. **Done for the properties
   that matter so far.**
3. **Application layer** — edit maps safely, render them, validate them, and
   generate them. **In progress. This is where all remaining work is.**

---

### PORT IN PROGRESS — Java → C++20 (started 2026-08-21)

The "Java library, Java 21" line above describes the ORIGINAL implementation,
kept at ~/Documents/PZMapCreation and now used as the **port oracle**. Active
development is a C++20 rewrite committed to this repo (PZMapMaker), flat layout,
CMake+Ninja, CLion. Java source is picked up from the PZMapCreation repo; C++
and updated docs are committed here.

**Why C++.** Qt6 Widgets for the desktop UI (the toolkit TileZed/QGIS/Qt Creator
use, native on KDE) and OpenGL 4.6 for the viewport. The performance argument
for leaving the JVM was NOT measured — no interactive viewport existed to
profile — so it is not the stated basis; UI toolkit fit is. Recorded honestly
so a later session does not cite a benchmark that was never run.

**Port verification = §4 independent source.** Every ported unit is checked
against the Java tree, not only its own tests: a shared synthetic input is fed
to both, outputs must be byte-identical, repeated across the full vanilla
dataset. Self-tests alone are NOT sufficient — read and write can share a wrong
assumption and agree (the mirrored-cell bug, §4).

### PNG Renderer

### DECISION 2026-08-21 — CellRenderer / SpriteAtlas deferred (not cut)

The offline PNG renderer (CellRenderer + SpriteAtlas) is DEFERRED, not ported
and not removed. Reasoning, so it is not re-litigated:

- It was always a DEVELOPER DIAGNOSTIC — "a file you can open and compare
  against the in-game map" — never a MapMaker feature. Charter §1 scope test:
  it does not edit, validate, or render a map a human is authoring in the tool.
- Its job (catch interpretation bugs by eye) is now done better by the
  cross-language oracle, which catches them NUMERICALLY and byte-exact. The two
  bugs it historically caught (x/y transposition, jumbo-tree scale) were
  GEOMETRY errors that the coordinate/atlas-index math surfaces without pixels.
- In-game remains the visual backstop; we are not locked out of visual checks.
- It is the first unit needing PNG decode/encode, which the C++ std library does
  not provide. That is an APP-LAYER image dependency (stb_image, or Qt's QImage
  once C3 commits to Qt). Deferring avoids committing the tree to an image lib
  before the viewport picks one.

When C3 (interactive viewport) lands, the render MATH (isometric projection,
painter's order, sprite trim, 2x-pack half-scale) ports then, against whatever
image/GL path Qt provides. The atlas INDEX logic (entry tables, page dropping,
"earlier pack wins", scale-is-per-pack) is pure and could be ported dependency-
free earlier if a validation rule needs it.

### Editor-track inventory (2026-08-21) — what remains vs what is out of scope

PORTED + verified vs Java on retail: LE, LEW, LotHeader, LotPack, TileDefs,
TileBin, PackFile, SpriteNames, CellData, TileIndex, Square, MapValidator.

EDITOR-TRACK, NOT YET PORTED:
- CellEditor (253 lines) — layer-aware editing with undo/redo over CellData.
  This is the core edit loop C1's viewport drives. NEXT.
- SpriteJoin (107 lines) — properties-but-no-pixels join; a candidate 6th
  validation rule. Needs only sprite NAMES (SpriteNames), not the atlas pixels,
  so it is NOT blocked by the CellRenderer deferral.

OUT OF SCOPE for the editor (Charter §2 GIS side-project or read-only surveys):
- Generation palettes: TilePalette, BiomePalette, TreePalette, GroundMaterial,
  WaterTiles, MaskRule, PaletteScan, WorldGenBiomes, WorldGenFeatures.
- Read-only vanilla surveys (taught the rules, write nothing, editor never
  calls): RoomShapes, RoomMinimums, RoomLayout, HouseLayouts, FootprintAngles,
  WallCycle, plus the *Probe/*Analysis/*Survey harnesses.
- GIS plumbing: Json, GeoJson, GisImport, GisCells, and the Gis* / *Rule family.

These are ported only if and when a specific editor feature needs them, per
Charter §2 ("GIS features are worth building only when they teach something the
editor needs, or when they are nearly free").

**Ported and CONFIRMED (2026-08-21):**

| Unit | Verified against |
|---|---|
| LE / LEW | 318 self-checks; Latin-1 byte fidelity |
| MappedFile | new; mmap streaming, no Java equivalent |
| LotHeader | 4065 cells byte-identical, both trees |
| LotPack | 4065 cells / 4,162,560 chunks byte-identical |
| TileDefs | text parse; index formula vs // comments |
| TileBin | 37,060 tiles, binary vs text prop maps identical |
| PackFile | both .pack layouts round-trip; legacy 0xDEADBEEF |
| SpriteNames | 46,540 names, identical count Java vs C++ |

**CORRECTION (moved here, not deleted).** LotPack encoder policy was assumed
SPAN_LEVELS_MINIMAL. Full-dataset round-trip proved **SPAN_LEVELS_FULL** —
4,162,560/4,162,560 chunks, 100%. MINIMAL scored 76%, matching only cells whose
last data square lands on a level boundary; the synthetic test cell passed it by
coincidence. Default corrected.

**FINDING — vegetation_trees_01 has no atlas sprite.** 24 texturepacks hold
46,540 names, NONE under `vegetation_trees_01`. Vegetation sheets present are
foliage/ornamental/indoor/farming/gardening/drying only. Tree tiles authored by
TreeScatter (`vegetation_trees_01_8/10/11`) are tiledefs-only names with no
pixels — the properties-but-no-pixels case SpriteNames exists to catch. In-game
trees rely on load-time species substitution (§11), not a direct atlas hit.
RENDERER IMPLICATION (C3): an authored tile is not guaranteed a sprite; the
renderer must flag or substitute. "Authored tile with no atlas sprite" is a
validation rule (A4/C5) — the smarter-than-a-paint-program check that is the
project's point (§1).

**Storage changes (invisible to the format).** LE reads over std::span, not an
owned byte[], so a cell can be mmap'ed and chunks decoded on demand. LotPack
Chunk stores only the levels it has (flat vectors + one contiguous tile pool)
instead of Java's MAX_LEVELS×8×8 pointer array per chunk.

**Environment gotcha.** Files authored off-machine can carry future timestamps;
Ninja then loops "manifest still dirty after 100 tries." Fix: `touch *.cpp *.hpp
CMakeLists.txt` after dropping in new files, then rebuild.

**Repo hygiene.** The build/ directory was committed by mistake (object files,
CMakeCache with absolute paths, test binaries). A .gitignore now excludes it;
remove it from tracking with `git rm -r --cached build`.

**Ported next (app-layer gate):** CellData, Square — where the format model
becomes an editable cell. Then C1 can be written against a real C++ stack.


Why the semantic layer is the whole competitive argument: `.tiles` property data
(`IsWall`, `IsDoor`, facing, container type, NorthWall/WestWall pairing) is what
makes an editor smarter than a paint program — auto wall-joining, room
detection, and validation rules like *doorway with no adjacent floor*, *room
with no exit*, *wall gap that isn't a door*. That is exactly where the official
tools are weakest, and where a new editor earns its place. TileZed lets you
paint an invalid map; this should not.

### The GIS pipeline is a side project, not the goal

`GisImport` / `GisCells` turn public-domain GIS data into a playable map mod.
It exists for two reasons:

- **A fast, honest exercise of the whole stack.** It authors cells from nothing
  — headers, tile tables, floors, walls, rooms, buildings, chunk grid, spawn
  points, biome maps — so every layer gets used end to end rather than
  unit-tested in isolation.
- **It is how the engine's mod contract was learned.** Almost everything now
  known about how B42 accepts an authored map (§5) was discovered by making a
  generated map load and then diagnosing why it didn't look right. An editor
  needs that contract regardless of who authors the tiles.

It is also a genuinely useful quick-start path — real town in, playable map out
— so it stays. But when the two tracks conflict, the editor wins, and GIS
features are only worth building when they teach something the editor needs.

---

## 2. Where things stand

### Editor track

Working today, verified:

- Read any vanilla or mod cell, modify it, write it back; the game accepts it.
- **Layer-aware editing** (`CellEditor`): `setFloor`, `setWall(edge, tile)`,
  `removeWall(edge)`, `addObject`, `clearObjects`, `clearSquare`, `fillFloor`,
  `outlineRoom`. Replacing a floor leaves walls, overlays and objects intact;
  removing a wall takes its door leaf or window pane with it.
- **Grouped undo/redo** that restores byte-identical output. A 36-square fill
  undoes in one step.
- Isometric rendering to PNG — correct projection, trimmed-sprite offsets,
  mixed 1×/2× atlases, z-stepping.
- Square-level semantic resolution: floor, north/west walls, doorways, windows,
  fixtures, containers, movement blocking, room membership.

The proof, on Muldraugh cell 42_40 — re-flooring a 6×6 living room:

```
before:      2 north walls, 12 west walls, 1 door, 1 window, 24 objects
after:       2 north walls, 12 west walls, 1 door, 1 window, 24 objects
destructive: 0              0              0        0         0
diff after undo: none
lotpack bytes identical to the original file: true
```

Not built yet: TMX/PZW interop, `.tiles` writers, auto wall-joining, validation
rules, any interactive UI, live rendering. Rendering is offline PNG only.

**One open thread flagged and never closed.** `outlineRoom` places north walls
at `y0+h` and west walls at `x0+w` — the far edges belonging to the *next*
square out. That follows from edge-based walls, but it is **reasoning, not
measurement**, and reasoning is what produced the x/y transposition and the
`attachedN` bug. The check is cheap: read a real Muldraugh room's actual wall
positions and compare against what `outlineRoom` generates for the same
rectangle. Do this before building anything on top of room creation.

**CLOSED 2026-08-10 — the offsets are correct. See §18.** The thread was
already stale when written: `Probe roomgeom` had made the measurement and
§10 recorded it.

### GIS track

The pipeline works end to end. A GIS area becomes 4 cells that load in game
with correct roads, buildings, ground and vegetation, and **no visible boundary
against the surrounding procedurally generated land**. The most recent win was
the biome map (§6), which is what made terrain continuous across the map edge —
the engine now generates vegetation on our cells from the same rules it uses
everywhere else.

Buildings are the weak point on both tracks: currently one bounding box per
footprint with derived perimeter walls. No roof, no interior subdivision, no
doors, no windows.

## 3. What is next, in order — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §3 on 2026-09-01.** Superseded. Item 1 is done (§18); item 2 is the still-open A2-gate, carried live in §25; items 3 and 4 are CHUNKS B1/B2 and B6. The live ordering is `CHUNKS.md` plus the §40 handoff.
>
> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§3)` references still resolve.

## 4. How to work on this project

This matters more than it usually would. **Eight real bugs got through 224
automated tests. All eight were caught by comparison against an independent
source, never by more testing of the same kind.**

- **Check what vanilla does before building anything.** Retail map data and the
  game's own Lua under `media/lua/server/WorldGen/` are readable and
  authoritative. Skipping this has cost three multi-session detours.
- **Prefer the recipe to the output.** Measuring Muldraugh describes one
  hand-authored town. Reading the generator's Lua describes the generator, works
  anywhere, and survives a game update.
- **Predict the number before running the command.** "squares should be
  3,145,728 and edge-filled 671,718" turns a run into a test.
- **Ask what would falsify a result.** A test that cannot fail proves nothing.
  An underdetermined linear system is trivially consistent.
- **Report rates over the population that can discriminate.** A 67.63% floor
  from trivially-empty files made noise look like signal for two sessions.
- **Sample spatial data contiguously.** A strided sample can alias. A 4-tile
  transect through a dithered ground boundary returned four identical
  materials in a row and was read as a region band; the contiguous row is
  `M D M D M M M D D`. Two ground transects were wrong this way (§26).
- **A sampling tool's cap is part of the measurement.** `Probe findprop` is
  hard-capped at 3 hits per cell by `PropsProbe.find`. Built into a rate, it
  produced a clean, plausible, entirely void result — "100% width 1", which
  happened to agree with the hypothesis under test. A 3-square sample cannot
  produce a run longer than 1. Check what a tool *can* return before believing
  what it did return (§27).
- **A test one layer above the bug cannot see it.** `MaskRule`'s self-test
  checked direction-set to tile-offset and passed 8/8 while N and W were
  transposed in the direction-to-neighbour table one layer below. `MaskAudit`
  could not see it either, because it reads vanilla rather than our output.
  The render caught it in one look. When a test passes, ask which layer it
  actually exercises (§29).
- **TIS's tile names are data, not our identifiers.** A blind textual rename of
  "overlay" to "tuft" ate the string literal `blends_grassoverlays_01_`,
  silently zeroing the tuft layer. The guard searched for the OLD spelling, so
  it could see under-renaming and was blind to over-renaming. Rename our
  identifiers; never their strings (§29).
- **Change one thing per test.**
- **The renderer is a hypothesis too.** It has been wrong twice. When the
  picture looks wrong, the picture may be what is wrong.
- **PZ is Java.** `unzip projectzomboid.jar`, Vineflower, and
  `grep -rl <symbol> --include='*.class'` beat inference from file bytes. Ten
  minutes with a decompiler has repeatedly answered what statistics could not.
- **Byte-identical round-tripping proves a format was read and written
  faithfully. It says nothing about whether it was *interpreted* correctly.**

Working style that has been productive: propose an approach, name the check that
would prove it wrong, run it, then write code.

**Patch delivery:** patches come as Python scripts that abort unless each anchor
matches exactly once. Fish has no heredocs, so multi-line edits need a file.
Files are handed over as downloads to `~/Downloads`, then copied into the repo.

## 5. Environment and machine layout

Garuda Linux, **fish shell**, Java 21 (toolchain targets 21; library is Java 17+
compatible), IntelliJ.

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| Git repo | `~/Documents/PZMapCreation` (source in `src/main/java/pzformat/`) |
| Scratch / probes | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF` |
| Extracted game jar | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/pzjar/` |
| Decompiled classes | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/` |
| Vineflower | `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/vineflower.jar` (1.12.0, fat jar) |
| Game install (`$PZ`) | `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid` |
| Vanilla maps (`$MAPS`) | `$PZ/media/maps` — Muldraugh, KY is the 4065-cell reference |
| GIS inputs | `~/pzgis/` — `area.geojson`, `buildings.geojson`, `roads.geojson`, `fetch_gis.py` |
| Generated mod | `~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/` |
| Renders | `~/pzrender/` |
| Saves | `~/Zomboid/Saves/<mode>/<timestamp>/` |

```fish
set -U PZ   "/home/kaatlev/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid"
set -U MAPS "$PZ/media/maps"
```

If `$MAPS` expands empty, a *global* shadows the universal. Diagnose with
`set -S MAPS`; clear with repeated `set -e MAPS`, then re-`set -U`.

### Gotchas that have each cost real time

- **Run from the repo root.** `-cp out` is relative; from `~` it fails with
  `ClassNotFoundException` and nothing else.
- **`ls` is aliased to eza**, which rejects `-t` combined with a bare `-d`. Use
  `command ls` when a glob result matters. A wrong `ls` once hid 33 of 34 saves
  and derailed an investigation for several exchanges.
- **fish has no heredocs.** Multi-line scripts must go in a file.
- **Patch backups**: `.gitignore` carries `*bak`. Several `.treebak` /
  `.spawnbak` files got committed before that was broadened.

### Mod layout that works (copied from Maplewood)

```
~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/
├── 42/mod.info                         version metadata ONLY, versionMin=42.0
└── common/media/maps/PZGisImport/
    ├── map.info                        needs fixed2x=true; lots=Muldraugh, KY
    ├── <x>_<y>.lotheader
    ├── world_<x>_<y>.lotpack           NOTE the different naming convention
    ├── maps/biomemap_<x>_<y>.png       biome + zone, one pixel per tile
    ├── spawnpoints.lua
    ├── objects.lua                     currently {}; vanilla's is 4 MB
    └── WorldGenOverride.lua            superseded; remove
```

Two naming conventions in one directory, and a mismatch fails silently.

### The two GIS commands

Recovered from shell history three separate times on 2026-08-11 and
guessed wrong twice before that. They are not interchangeable: `gisimport`
writes a schematic PNG for eyeballing, `giscells` writes the actual mod.

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe gisimport \
    ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/roads.geojson ~/pzgis/area.geojson \
    ~/pzgis

java -cp out pzformat.Probe giscells \
    ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/roads.geojson ~/pzgis/area.geojson \
    "$PZ/media" ~/Zomboid/mods PZGisImport
```

Current dataset: 7 buildings (6 Residential, 1 Agriculture), 1 road,
495x424 tiles, generating 2x2 cells at 200_200..201_201.

---

## 6. What already exists — do not rebuild

### Java source, `src/main/java/pzformat/`

Refresh the real list with `find src -name '*.java' | sort` — this is the
inventory as of the last session.

**Format layer**: `LE`, `LEW`, `LotHeader`, `LotPack`, `LotPackAnalysis`,
`CellData`, `PackFile`, `PackAnalysis`, `TileDefs`, `TileBin`, `TileBinAnalysis`,
`TrailerAnalysis`, `Json`

**Semantics / rendering**: `TileIndex`, `Square`, `SpriteAtlas`, `SpriteJoin`,
`SpriteNames`, `CellRenderer`, `RoomGeometry`, `PropsProbe`

**Editing**: `CellEditor`, `EditDemo`, `MakeTestMod`, `Locate`, `SpawnMark`

**GIS pipeline**: `GisImport`, `GisCells`, `TilePalette`, `GroundPalette`,
`TreePalette`, `TreeScatter`, `BiomeMapWriter`

**WorldGen data**: `WorldGenFeatures`, `WorldGenBiomes`, `BiomePalette`

**Probes**: `Probe` (CLI), `SelfTest`, `Survey`, `RoundTrip`, `PaletteScan`,
`TreeSurvey`, `GroundSurvey`, `LegacyPackProbe`

Notable internals worth knowing before touching them:

- `LE.java` tracks read position and dumps hex on failure — every parse error
  names a byte offset. `LE.hexDump()` at that offset is the debugging loop.
- `CellData.fill` replaces a square's **entire** tile stack. That is correct for
  "clear" and wrong for everything else — it is why an early in-game test
  punched holes through houses. `CellEditor` exists because of this.
- `CellEditor` routes every mutation through `apply()`, so undo is uniform:
  an edit is the before/after state of the squares it touched.
- `GisCells.assertNoEmptySquares` reimplements the engine's chunk gate (§7)
  against the **reparsed** cell, not the in-memory one.

### Python on the machine

- `~/pzgis/fetch_gis.py` — the only permanent Python. Fetches buildings and
  roads for an area polygon. **Already fixed** to probe all nine TIGERweb layers
  and deduplicate on geometry (§11). Do not rewrite it from scratch.
- `~/Downloads/patch_*.py` — transient patch scripts, one per edit, safe to
  delete after applying.

### Probe commands

Standalone (run directly, not via `Probe`):

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PaletteScan <media> <prefix>` | Tiles under a prefix: sprite, kind, CustomName, Material, flags |
| `PaletteScan <media> --prop <key>` | Distinct values of a property across all tiles |
| `PaletteScan <media> --find <text>` | Tiles whose CustomName contains text |
| `TreeSurvey <media>` | `tree` size classes mapped to tilesets and species |
| `GroundSurvey <mapdir> <cell>...` | How vanilla composes ground squares |
| `WorldGenFeatures <media> [CAT]` | Parsed feature tile lists |
| `WorldGenBiomes <media> [biome]` | Parsed biome feature references with `p` |
| `BiomePalette <media> [biome] [n]` | Composed sample squares for a biome |
| `LegacyPackProbe <file \| dir>` | Walk legacy `.pack`, verify against PNG offsets |

Via `Probe`: `survey`, `mapdir`, `lotheader`, `lotpack`, `roundtrip`, `pack`,
`packinfo`, `sprites`, `props`, `square`, `findprop`, `gisimport`, `giscells`,
`render`, `editdemo`.

**The two that matter most for verification:**

```
square   <mediadir> <mapdir> <X_Y> <x> <y> <z>     dump every tile + properties
findprop <mediadir> <mapdir> <X_Y> <prop>          find squares having a property
```

Point them at `"$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"` to see what vanilla does, and at the
generated mod to see what we do. **Comparing the two is the single most
effective technique in this project.**

### The loop

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
python3 ~/Downloads/patch_x.py            # if patching
javac -d out (find src -name '*.java')
java -cp out pzformat.SelfTest 2>&1 | tail -3
rm -rf ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport
java -cp out pzformat.Probe giscells ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/roads.geojson ~/pzgis/area.geojson "$PZ/media" ~/Zomboid/mods PZGisImport
java -Xmx4g -cp out pzformat.Probe render ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport "$PZ/media/texturepacks" 200_200 80 157 64 0 0 ~/pzrender/x.png
```

The render is fast feedback but **only shows authored data**. Anything WorldGen
generates — trees, bushes, grass, ore — is invisible to it and must be checked
in game.

Refresh before starting:

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
find src -name '*.java' | sort
git log --oneline -15
```

---

## 7. Engine behaviour — CONFIRMED in the decompiler

### What gates generation

In `zombie/iso/worldgen/WorldGenChunk.generateChunks`:

```java
if (ch.hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()) {
    genRandomChunk(...);      // full procedural generation
} else {
    genMapChunk(...);         // treated as authored — still reads the biome map
    cleanChunk(ch, "Sand",   "vegetation_groundcover_01");
    cleanChunk(ch, "Road_*", "vegetation_groundcover_01");
}
```

`IsoChunk.hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()` returns true if **any** of a chunk's 64
squares has no object at z=0 or below. One gap flips the whole chunk to
procedural. The engine treats a `null` square as empty, so a mirror assertion
must check a square object **exists**, not merely that it is non-empty.

**`cleanChunk` is harmless to us — CONFIRMED.** It matches on the floor's
`FloorMaterial` property, not the sprite name, and removes only objects whose
sprite name starts with `vegetation_groundcover_01`:

```java
String floorMaterial = floor.getSprite().getProperties().get("FloorMaterial");
if (floorMaterial != null && floorMaterial.matches("^Road.*")) { ... }
```

Our grass carries `FloorMaterial = Grass_Dark`. Authored roads are never
touched. This closed the oldest open question in the project.

### Registration as an authored cell

`MapFiles.load()`: `*.lotheader` → `createLotHeader()`, the only thing that
expands bounds and registers into `infoHeaders`. `*.lotpack` → `infoFileNames`
only. `chunkdata_*` → no bounds effect, no `bgHasCell`.

`IsoMetaGrid.CreateStep1` merges `MapFiles` backwards with `putAll`, so for a
contested cell the *earlier* map directory wins. Scanning starts at
`Core.gameMap` and recurses through `getLotDirectories()`. Our `map.info` has
`lots=Muldraugh, KY`, so vanilla is scanned alongside us and bounds are the
union. **CONFIRMED working** — `console.txt` shows `PZGisImport` followed by the
Knox County chain.

### Geometry

Chunk = 8×8 tiles. Cell = 256×256 tiles = 32×32 chunks. **PZwiki's File Formats
page documents B41 and is wrong for B42** on magic bytes, string terminators,
cell size, offset width and chunk size.

### Coordinate systems — the bug that cost three sessions

`spawnpoints.lua` `worldX`/`worldY` are **legacy 300-tile cell coordinates**.
`posX`/`posY` are offsets within that 300-tile cell.

Emitting `worldX = 200` for cell 200_200 put the player at world tile
200 × 300 = 60000 while the cells occupy 51200..51711 — about 8,800 tiles east,
in pure procedural terrain. That looked exactly like "WorldGen destroyed my map"
and produced a recorded blocker that never existed.

```java
int worldTileX = cellX * 256 + localX;
worldX = worldTileX / 300;
posX   = worldTileX % 300;
```

**Diagnostic that found it:** the save's `map/` subdirectories are named by
chunk. They were 7530–7570 (world tile ~60240 ≈ 200.8 × 300) instead of the
expected 6400–6463. **When a map "does not load", read the chunk directory
numbers first.** They say where the player actually was.

The same 300-vs-256 legacy compatibility appears in `MapFiles.postLoad`, which
converts bounds with `minX * 256.0F / 300.0F`.

### Reading vanilla spawnpoints — the inverse conversion

§7 recorded the forward transform only, which is why finding a known-good
vanilla building has been done by eye. The inverse is the useful direction:
a spawnpoint is a coordinate someone at TIS chose deliberately, and vanilla
spawns are inside buildings.

```
$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY/spawnpoints.lua        plain Lua, readable
```

```java
int worldTileX = worldX * 300 + posX;      // legacy 300-tile cell -> world tile
int cellX      = worldTileX / 256;         // B42 256-tile cell
int localX     = worldTileX % 256;         // square within that cell
```

Same for Y. Feed `cellX_cellY` to `Probe lotheader` and `localX localY` to
`Probe square`. **UNVERIFIED**: that vanilla B42 keeps spawnpoints in this
file and this format at all. Confirm by reading it before relying on it; if
the shape differs, that fact belongs here.

## 8. The WorldGen data model

All plain Lua under `$PZ/media/lua/server/WorldGen/`, and all parseable —
`WorldGenFeatures` and `WorldGenBiomes` do it.

### Features — `features/<CATEGORY>/<n>.lua`

Categories: `BUSH`, `GROUND`, `NONE`, `ORE`, `PLANT`, `TREE`. 89 features across
90 files. Each is a list of tile names:

```lua
local medium_grass = {
    main = { "blends_natural_01_32", "blends_natural_01_37",
             "blends_natural_01_38", "blends_natural_01_39" },
}
worldgen.features.GROUND["medium_grass"] = medium_grass
```

**The nine GROUND features are exactly the four-tile groups** that a statistical
survey of Muldraugh independently found — a good cross-check of both:

| feature | tiles (`blends_natural_01_*` unless noted) |
|---|---|
| `sand` | 0, 5, 6, 7 |
| `dark_grass` | 16, 21, 22, 23 |
| `medium_grass` | 32, 37, 38, 39 |
| `light_grass` | 48, 53, 54, 55 |
| `dirt` | 64, 69, 70, 71 |
| `dirt_grass` | 80, 85, 86, 87 |
| `clay` | 96, **101**, 102, 103 |
| `water` | `blends_natural_02_0, 5, 6, 7` |
| `burnt` | `floors_burnt_01_8, 13, 14, 15` |

`blends_natural_01_101` is **clay** — which is why an early palette that picked
it produced brown ground.

### Biomes — two separate tables

- `biomes/worldgen/<n>.lua` → `worldgen.biomes[...]`. 76 entries (10 files plus
  ore-level variants using `parent`). **Have a GROUND feature.** These are what
  `WorldGenOverride.lua` selects.
- `biomes/map/<n>.lua` → `worldgen.biomes_map[...]`. **No GROUND feature** —
  they are applied to authored cells, where the floor already exists. These are
  what the biome map selects.
- `biomes/subbiomes/<n>.lua` → shared components (`grass`, `bushes`,
  `small_trees`, `no_tree`, …).

A biome entry:

```lua
features = {
    GROUND = { { f = worldgen.features.GROUND.medium_grass, p = 1.0 } },
    PLANT  = { { f = worldgen.features.PLANT.grass_medium,  p = 0.3 } },
    BUSH   = { { f = worldgen.features.BUSH.bush_regular,   p = 0.01 } },
    TREE   = { { f = worldgen.features.TREE.maple_jumbo_xxl, p = 0.00125 }, ... },
}
```

`params.placements` decides which **floor tiles** a feature category may sit on,
as globs with `!` exclusions:

```lua
placements = {
    GENERIC = { "blends_natural_01_*" },
    PLANT   = { "!blends_natural_01_0", "!_5", "!_6", "!_7",
                "!blends_natural_01_64", "!_69", "!_70", "!_71" },
}
```

That exclusion list is `sand` and `dirt`. It is why dirt tiles end up bare.

---

## 9. The biome map — how terrain is really assigned

**CONFIRMED** by decompiling `zombie.iso.worldgen.maps.BiomeMap`, `BiomeRaster`,
and `WorldGenChunk`.

`<map>/maps/biomemap_<cellX>_<cellY>.png`, 256×256, one pixel per tile.

```java
private static final int NUM_BANDS = 2;
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    this.pixels[x * 2 + i + y * span] = (byte) pixel[i];
```

**RED = biome band, GREEN = zone band, BLUE ignored.** `BiomeMap.Type` is
`BIOME(0)`, `ZONE(1)` — a band selector, not a flag. Both bands index the same
`biome_map_config` table in `media/lua/server/metazones/BiomeMapConfig.lua`, via
`getBiomeName(index)` and `getZoneName(index)`.

That explains vanilla's colour families: `(153,153,153)` is one entry used for
both bands; `(254,141,254)` is biome 254 `dirt` inside zone 141 `FarmLand`;
`(179,64,64)` is biome 179 `pr_forest` inside zone 64 `ForagingNav`.

`getRaster` searches every map in `IsoWorld.getMap()` (semicolon separated) and
takes the first file that exists. **A missing file logs a debug line and returns
null** — safe and incremental.

Config values worth knowing: 0 Water, 64 ForagingNav, 96 `$random`/DeepForest,
115 `townhouse`/TownZone, 128 `farmmix_forest`/Farm, 141 …/FarmLand,
153 `ph_forest`/PHForest, 179 `pr_forest`/PRForest, 204 `farm_forest`/FarmForest,
217 `birch_forest`/BirchForest, 243 `organic_forest`/OrganicForest,
254 `dirt`/ForagingNav, 255 `primary_forest`/DeepForest.

### What it drives — and what it takes away from us

`genMapChunk` runs on **authored** chunks and reads the biome map:

```java
int[] biomes = map.getZones(ch.wx, ch.wy, Type.BIOME);
BiomeMapEntry lookup = map.getEntry(biomes[tileY * 8 + tileX]);
```

Then per tile, for each of TREE, BUSH, PLANT:

```java
if (!canPlace(biome.placements().get(type), floorName))
    square.DeleteTileObject(currentTiles.get(type));      // wrong floor -> delete
else
    retval = applyBiome(biome, type, ...);                // else replace with biome's own
// on SUCCESS, delete every other tree/bush/grass-like object on the square
```

So:

- **We author**: floors, roads, walls, buildings, rooms. The engine does not
  replace floors — map biomes have no GROUND feature.
- **The engine owns**: trees, bushes, grass — deleted and replaced per tile from
  the biome map.

**OBSERVED in game:** with biome maps written, walking outward from the road
passes through the authored gradient (town → farm_forest → ph_forest →
primary_forest), with correct species, boulders from ORE features, and **no seam
at the cell boundary**. The biome map takes precedence over
`WorldGenOverride.lua` on authored chunks.

`replaceSquare` is narrower: only `biome.getReplacements()`, mapping specific
sprite names to alternatives. Not a wholesale floor swap.

**Consequence for ground choice:** because `placements` excludes `sand` and
`dirt` from PLANT and BUSH, any dirt tile we author ends up **bare**, with
surrounding grass tufts stripped off it. Scattering dirt at 14% (a figure
measured from hand-authored Muldraugh) produced exactly that: bare diamonds
through otherwise mixed forest, stopping dead at the cell boundary.
`GroundPalette` now uses grass groups only; dirt is retained as named constants
for deliberate use — tracks, yards, unpaved roads.

## 10. Format layer — CONFIRMED

| Format | Verification |
|---|---|
| `.lotheader` | 4065 / 4065 cells; byte-identical |
| `.lotpack` | 4065 / 4065 cells, 4,162,560 chunks; byte-identical |
| `.pack` | **24 / 24 retail atlases**, both layouts; byte-identical |
| `.tiles` binary | 73,644 tiles; all 37,060 with a text sibling match 100% |
| `.tiles` text | 61,418 tiles from 7 files, 616 tilesets |
| `biomemap_X_Y.png` | Format read in the engine; writer produces loadable maps |
| Room geometry | Wall offsets across 86 rooms, both far sides confirmed |

### `.lotheader`

```
char[4]  "LOTH"
int32    version          1
int32    tileCount
         tileName '\n'    x tileCount
int32    levelsAbove      8 in all 4065 cells
int32    levelsBelow      8
int32    minLevel         actual z of chunk index 0; negative for basements
int32    maxLevel

         int32 objectCount; int32 a,b,c x objectCount
int32    buildingCount
  building: int32 roomCount; int32 roomIndex x roomCount
byte[1024]  32x32 per-chunk grid, values 0..10
```

90,827 rooms and 90,827 room references — every room belongs to exactly one
building. **Wall convention: south wall belongs to the next square down, east
wall to the next square right.**

### `.pack` — both layouts

The entry table is identical in both, **and so is the per-page `int32` after
`numEntries`**. Believing that field was PZPK-only was the entire bug: the
reader skipped it, read its value as the first entry's name length, and derailed
on byte one.

```
[optional] char[4]   "PZPK"
[optional] int32     version
int32                numPages
page * numPages:
    lenString        pageName
    int32            numEntries
    int32            unknown            1 almost always, but 0 on three pages of
                                        UI.pack — NOT a version constant
    entry * numEntries:
        lenString    entryName
        int32 x, y, w, h, ox, oy, fx, fy
    [PZPK]   int32   pngByteLength
    byte[]           pngBytes
    [legacy] int32   0xDEADBEEF         page separator
```

Legacy PNGs have **no length prefix** — walk chunk headers to IEND. Validation
that can fail: after walking `numEntries` entries the offset must land
**exactly** on a PNG magic. All 20 pages across the 11 legacy files did.

`0xDEADBEEF` absence after the final page is **UNVERIFIED** — an IEND walk
landing on EOF is indistinguishable from one landing 4 bytes short then
consuming a separator. `pageSeparator` is recorded per page, not derived.

### Sprite scale is a property of the pack, not the sprite

`scale = packName.contains("2x") ? 0.5 : 1.0`. The old `fx >= 128 ? 0.5 : 1.0`
heuristic held only while the pack list was `Tiles1x` (64px) and `Tiles2x`
(128px); jumbo tree art is 1× at 192×256 and got shrunk to ground-level blobs.

**`SpriteAtlas.MAP_PACKS` is a hardcoded list.** A pack absent from it is
invisible to the renderer regardless of whether `PackFile` can parse it.

Still open in the format layer: the 3-int32 room object records; `.tiles`
writers; TMX interop; `objects.lua` / `roomtones.lua` / `streets.xml` parsing.

### `chunkdata_X_Y.bin` — closed as a question, not a format

Zombie population data. **No influence on WorldGen.** `natives/libPZPopMan64.so`
exports `..._n_1saveCell`, `..._n_1loadChunk`, `..._n_1addZombie`;
`LoadGameScreen.lua:231` offers a debug item `DeleteChunkDataXYBin`;
`MapFiles.load()` registers it with no bounds or `bgHasCell` effect. Four probe
generations killed every structural hypothesis. If ever needed, **decompile
`zombie.popman.*`** rather than probing bytes again.

Trap that wasted two sessions: 2749 of 4065 files have N=0, so naive success
rates carry a **67.63% floor that means nothing**. Report over N>0 files. Second
trap: "fits `2 + 1024 + N*64`" is arithmetically identical to "fits `2 + M*64`",
since 1024 = 16×64.

---

## 11. Tiles, sprites, trees

**Tile definitions and sprite atlases are independent sets.** 61,418 tiles carry
properties; 46,540 sprite names exist. A tile can pass every property filter and
have no pixels — it writes correctly, round-trips byte-identically, satisfies
`hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()`, and renders as a checkerboard. No existing test
catches that. `SpriteNames.load()` builds the sprite set; `TilePalette` requires
membership.

### Authored data cannot choose tree species — CONFIRMED

Vanilla Muldraugh 35_35 authors exactly `vegetation_trees_01_8` … `_11`. No
species tile appears in any vanilla lotheader. Those generic tiles carry `tree`,
`solid`, `attachedFloor`, `BlocksPlacement`, `vegitation` — and **have no sprite
in any atlas**. The engine substitutes species and mature size at runtime.

The `e_redmapleJUMBO_1` / `e_virginiapineJUMBOXXL_1` sheets (11 species × 8 size
classes) are **render-time art**. Authoring them produces canopies lying on the
grass, because a 192×256 full frame is 1× art that overhangs its square, not 2×
art to be halved.

Given §9, authoring trees at all is pointless — `genMapSquare` deletes them.

### Useful discriminating properties

| Need | Discriminator |
|---|---|
| Grass vs dirt | `grassFloor` bare flag |
| Standalone ground vs edge blend | `solidfloor` present, `FloorOverlay` absent |
| House interior floor | `Material = Wood`; `Brick` is bathroom/kitchen tiling |
| Trunk vs ground cover | `solid` on the `vegetation_trees_01` sheet |

`CustomName` exists on interior floors but is **absent on all natural ground and
tree tiles**, so it cannot be the general selector.

Wall encoding: `wall` is a bare flag with no orientation. An earlier version
keyed off `attachedN`/`attachedW` and validated at 99.5% against room geometry
**while being wrong** — decoration hangs on walls, so it occupies the same
squares. A correlated proxy can pass a test for the wrong reason.

---

## 12. The GIS pipeline

**Step 1 — draw the area** at <https://geojson.io>, save to `~/pzgis/area.geojson`.
One 256×256 cell ≈ **0.0023° lat × 0.0029° lon** around 38°N.

**Step 2 — fetch:** `python3 ~/pzgis/fetch_gis.py ~/pzgis/area.geojson ~/pzgis`

- **Buildings** — USA Structures (FEMA / Oak Ridge / USGS). Public domain.
  Carries `OCC_CLS` / `PRIM_OCC`. Only structures over 450 sq ft; machine
  extracted, so footprints can be a metre or two off.
- **Roads** — Census TIGER/Line. Public domain.

⚠️ **TIGERweb splits roads across layers 0–8** by class and scale. The original
script queried layer 2 only and silently returned zero features for anything
else — indistinguishable from "there is no road here". Pondlick Rd is in
**layer 7**, registered as `Co Hwy 26`. `fetch_gis.py` now probes all nine and
merges, deduplicating **on geometry, not `LINEARID`** (a road crossing the box
in two segments shares an ID).

**Step 3 — always pass `area.geojson`.** Feature services return whole features
intersecting the bbox, so one road can run for kilometres beyond your area.

**Step 4 — preview** with `gisimport`; a typical house should be **10–15 tiles
across**.

**Step 5 — `giscells`.** Cells are placed at origin **200_200**, clear of Knox
County.

Licensing is still open: verify GIS dataset terms per state and choose a licence
before publishing. Separately, **never redistribute extracted PZ tilesheets or
art** — read from the user's install. Format reverse-engineering is well
tolerated in this community; shipping TIS's assets is not.

Last generation run:

```
7 buildings (1530 tiles), 1 road (2808 tiles), extent 495 x 424
ground palette: 3 base groups, 54 overlays
cells written: 4   squares: 262144   rooms: 8   edge-filled: 52264
ground overlays: 132395 (50.5%)

## 13. Corrections — beliefs that turned out wrong

Acting on any of these wastes real time.

| Old claim | Status |
|---|---|
| "WorldGen paves over authored terrain" is the project blocker | **FALSE.** Never existed. It was the spawn coordinate bug (§7). |
| `spawnpoints.lua` uses B42 256-tile cells | **FALSE.** Legacy **300-tile** grid. |
| The 11 unparsed `.pack` atlases are cosmetic UI art | **FALSE.** Two are the tree atlases. All 24 now parse. |
| Interior floor renders as a missing-texture checkerboard | **FALSE.** It was `"Grey Diagonal Tiles"`, rendering correctly. |
| Map data can specify tree species and mature size | **FALSE.** Generic tiles only; the engine substitutes (§11). |
| Authoring vegetation into the lotpack works | **FALSE.** `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces TREE/BUSH/PLANT per tile (§9). |
| Ground should imitate Muldraugh's measured tile mix | **FALSE.** Muldraugh is hand-authored. Drive from biome definitions (§8, §9). |
| GIS footprints can be rasterized at their real-world bearing | **FALSE.** Room rects are `x, y, w, h` with no rotation field; walls are N/W edges only. Off-axis footprints stair-step and their rooms do not register cleanly (§17). |
| Vanilla `spawnpoints.lua` uses `worldX`/`worldY` plus 300-tile offsets | **FALSE for B42 retail.** Muldraugh's file has `posX`/`posY`/`posZ` only, as absolute world tiles. Our write path uses the legacy form and works, so the reader evidently accepts both (§18). |
| A cell's per-square room id identifies the room | **FALSE.** `-1` on every interior square sampled. Membership comes from lotheader rects only (§18). |
| The trees visible on the generated map are the engine's | **UNPROVEN, and evidence points the other way.** WorldGen skips chunks with no empty squares, and GisCells fills every square; our tree tiles are present in the lotpack. A2 step 1 is blocked until settled (§25). |
| A ground square is one base tile plus at most one overlay | **FALSE.** Vanilla stacks several base tiles per square at region boundaries — one square in 42_40 carries five. That stacking IS the blend mechanism (§24). The verdict stands but **the reason stated here is itself wrong**: a square carries exactly one solid tile. The others are mask tiles with `FloorOverlay` (§26). |
| Ground region choice tracks distance from habitation | **UNSUPPORTED.** Suggested by a town-vs-forest comparison, then not borne out by a fine transect. Region driver is still unknown (§24). **Still unsupported, but the fine transect no longer counts against it** — it was an aliasing artifact (§26). Nothing supports it either. For authored cells the driver is a human painting land use; for us it is GIS land use. |
| Terrain continuity was the remaining boundary problem | **INCOMPLETE.** The biome map made terrain continuous; POPULATION was never addressed. Zombies spawn on vanilla ground and stop dead at our boundary (§22). |
| Ground groups can be selected per square from their measured frequencies | **FALSE.** The 70/21/10 split across Muldraugh is a split BETWEEN regions, not within them. Vanilla shows 16/16 identical `Grass_Dark` in a row; ours changes three times in eight squares (§21). |
| Dropping the dirt groups was the fix for scattered bare diamonds | **SYMPTOM ONLY.** The cause is the missing region layer. Dirt is correct ground for tracks and yards and should return once regions exist (§21). |
| Off-axis rooms exist in vanilla Muldraugh | **UNSUPPORTED — printed by a broken guard, twice.** Both times the alignment test was measuring interior partitions, not skew. Current best answer: no off-axis room found (§19). |
| `alignment()` is a working prototype of A4's "expressible as a rect" rule | **OVERSTATED.** It took four attempts to stop false-positiving on vanilla, and it cannot test 80.3% of rects (§19). |
| Cell 200_200 can test `outlineRoom` | **FALSE.** GIS buildings do not go through `outlineRoom`, and their bbox rects do not match their diagonal wall runs. The measurement is void, not negative (§18). |
| Multi-user editing is a reason to prefer a Spring Boot + WebGL UI | **SUPERSEDED.** CHARTER §3, 2026-08-08: no multi-user concurrent editing. The UI fork stays open on other grounds. |
| A `Grass_Medium` band sits at x=112–124 in 42_40 inside `Grass_Dark`, with Dark on both sides | **FALSE — sampling artifact.** A 4-tile stride aliased a dithered boundary. There is no band (§26). |
| Filtering ground samples on `FloorMaterial` measures regions | **FALSE.** Mask tiles carry `FloorMaterial` too. Filter on `solidfloor`. This flaw is behind three of the four ground transects and behind §21's unexplained "25 `FloorMaterial` lines from 16 probes" (§26). |
| The biome map is what removed the map-edge seam | **INCOMPLETE.** `Blending.changeGround` feathers solid tiles 0–3 squares in from any edge shared with a procedural chunk. A second mechanism is doing visible work there (§26). |
| `GroundSurvey`'s "never more than one overlay, 0 of 257,703" describes ground stacking | **MEASURED THE TUFT LAYER ONLY.** True of `blends_grassoverlays_01`; it never counted mask tiles, which live on the base sheet (§26). |
| The engine will blend our authored ground at load | **FALSE.** `Blending.applyBlending` fires only where a chunk borders a **procedural** chunk, and it replaces solid tiles rather than writing masks. Every mask must be authored (§26). |
| `Clay` is the highest-priority natural material | **FALSE.** Asserted in-session from a 3-cell sample where `Clay > Grass_Dark` appeared at n=3. The full 4,065-cell corpus shows `Dirt > Clay` (1,119) and `Dirt_Grass > Clay` (1,038): **Clay is the lowest.** The n=3 reading sat inside the noise floor (§27). |
| Mask priority is a total order | **INCOMPLETE.** Every pair in the corpus shows both directions. Natural ground behaves as a rule with a 1-in-3,000 noise floor; similar road types do not separate cleanly, down to 2.5:1 (§27). |
| `FloorOverlay` identifies a blend mask | **INSUFFICIENT.** `street_curbs_01`, `overlay_grime_floor_01`, `industry_01` and `location_trailer_02` carry `FloorOverlay` with **no** `FloorMaterial` — they are decals. The discriminator needs `FloorOverlay` **and** `FloorMaterial` **and** a `FloorAttachment*` flag (§27). |
| Dither may be a 42_40 hand-painting quirk | **RESOLVED — it is general.** Mean single-square-island share 19.97% across all 4,065 Muldraugh cells. No curved or diagonal edge can produce a single-square component (§27). |
| The 16-tile mask block contract is uniform | **TRUE for natural ground only.** `blends_street_01` uses **8** masks per block, one variant set, not two. `Clay` uses 28 (§27). |
| Indices 112–127 of `blends_natural_01` are an unidentified side-mask set | **They carry `FloorMaterial Clay`.** Why clay has 28 mask indices where every other natural material has 12 is still UNVERIFIED (§27). |
| `Probe findprop` can measure a distribution | **FALSE.** Hard-capped at 3 hits per cell. It finds an example; it is never a census (§27). |
| The livingroom and kitchen are separated by a wall | **FALSE, and the reverse of a modern intuition.** 55.4% of vanilla livingroom/kitchen boundaries are FULLY OPEN, 33.0% partly, only **8.2% fully walled**. They are usually one continuous space (§35). |
| Always cutting the longer side keeps rooms well-proportioned | **FALSE for unbalanced splits.** A 2-square closet against a 42-square livingroom cuts nowhere near the middle, so on a wide region the cut pins at the minimum and yields a sliver running the full depth. Worst aspect was 7.0, and a 2×7 closet is 14 squares against vanilla's median of 2 — **the aspect defect and the size defect are the same defect** (§35). |
| A room's median size is a usable minimum | **FALSE.** Medians and minima differ by 2–3×: livingroom median 32 against a p5 of 16, bedroom 14 against 9, kitchen 21 against 9. The generator needs the p5, because the rule is "required rooms at their minimums, then bedrooms until the space runs out" (§35). |
| `RoomLayout` found only 10.5% of vanilla buildings recursively splittable, so the layout is not a BSP | **FALSE — the instrument was wrong.** It split on **bounding boxes**, and a room's box is not its shape: an L-shaped livingroom's box swallows whatever sits in its notch, so boxes overlap where the rooms do not. Splitting on **rects** gives **85.0%**, and 2-room buildings go from 66.1% to **100.0%** — which is the check that should have been run first, since two rooms failing to separate is near-impossible (§34). |
| Room count does not decide whether a building has a hallway | **FALSE.** It decides it almost by itself: 6.1% of 2–3 room buildings have one, 14.4% at 4–5, **57.3% at 6–7**, 84.9% at 8–10, 90% above. A clean sigmoid with the transition at 6–7 rooms. Asserted twice in-session that access rather than size was the factor; access is the *reason*, room count is what predicts it (§33). |
| The GIS footprint should decide what each building becomes | **SUPERSEDED by an owner decision, 2026-08-14.** GIS is authoritative for what EXISTS; gameplay is additive. Every real footprint stays a real building of its real class, and where the game needs something the data lacks it is **added** and attached to a host — never reclassified. Reclassification would destroy the provenance distinction permanently and invisibly (§33). |
| One PZ tile is one metre (assumed since the first import) | **CONFIRMED to 0.4%**, and only now. Total building tiles 1,409 against the dataset's own `SQMETERS` sum of 1,403 across seven footprints. The whole coordinate path rested on this and nothing had ever checked it (§32). |
| `GisImport.project` is a harmless coordinate conversion | **FALSE — it was quantising before measurement.** Rounding every vertex to an integer tile cost 2–7% of every footprint's area, always downward: all seven measured below their recorded `SQMETERS`. The loss is unrecoverable afterwards, because `FootprintSnap` never saw the precision (§32). |
| The jagged buildings were a room-rect problem | **FALSE, twice over.** `RoomShapes` on our own map: 8 rooms, 8 rects, fill ratio **1.000**, zero staircases — the room rects were already perfect rectangles. Nor was it a `deriveWalls` problem. The **raster** was: `fillPolygon` wrote the real 37–80° outline into `Cover.BUILDING`, and `deriveWalls` traced that while the room rect was computed separately as a bounding box (§31). |
| Buildings are rasterised as polygons, which snaps them to the grid for free (`GisImport` javadoc) | **FALSE.** Rasterising a polygon snaps its *tiles* to the grid; it does not make its *edges* axis-parallel, and the format needs the latter. The javadoc asserted the opposite of what the code needed to do for eleven days (§31). |
| §17: rotate the whole scene by the dominant footprint angle before rasterizing | **PREMISE FAILS on rural data, and is unnecessary anyway.** `FootprintAngles` over the current import: 7 footprints at 37, 61, 65, 71, 76, 80°, best ±3° window holding **33.3%** of area against §17's predicted "well over half". Scattered farmsteads each face their own driveway; there is no street grid because there is no street. And the target angle never needed discovering — see §30. |
| `RoomShapes` found 1,334 diagonal runs in vanilla, so §17's check 1 is answered | **FALSE — those are false positives and check 1 is still OPEN.** The detector fired on any two thin rects offset by 1 on both axes, which is every L-shaped closet: `[186,185 3x1]` then `[185,186 4x1]` is axis-aligned with a jog, not a diagonal. A real staircase is a **run** of rects each stepping consistently in the same direction, not a pair (§30). **Now ANSWERED with the corrected detector: 107 runs, 0.12%, and all 107 are widening rooms rather than staircases. The constraint is HARD (§30).** |
| Every block in a sheet has four solid variants | **FALSE for roads.** `blends_natural_01` does, all seven blocks. In `blends_street_01`, `Road_01` and `Road_02` have only **two** — B+6 and B+7 are spriteless. Solids must be listed per material, not computed (§29). |
| A passing self-test means the mask rule is implemented correctly | **INSUFFICIENT.** `MaskRule`'s self-test passed 8/8 with N and W transposed, because it never exercises the neighbour lookup. Point `MaskAudit` at our own output instead — it reads the map we wrote and checks masks against our neighbours (§29). |
| The generated road is too wide | **FALSE — it is 7 squares, exactly what `roadWidth("S1400") = 3` specifies.** Asserted three times from renders and refuted by one column count. The isometric projection makes a diagonal strip read far wider than it is (§29). |
| The GIS import carries land use (§22, §27) | **HALF TRUE, and the half that is false blocked E8.** `GisImport.Cover` is `{NONE, ROAD, BUILDING}`. Building footprints, road centrelines and a per-building occupancy class — no landcover. There is no evidence for multiple grass regions in open country, so E8 writes one (§28). |
| Dither is a coherent noise field | **FALSE.** Matched-distance lift is 0.95–1.14 on the boundary contour across every material pair and filter window, on 8,000+ pairs. Adjacent squares are independent. The 5–10× lift further out is a different population — genuine small regions the majority filter smoothed away (§28). |
| Vanilla's measured P(minority\|d) can be used directly as a flip probability | **FALSE.** They are different quantities: the measurement is the outcome after both sides of an edge have dithered. Using 0.27 as an input rate over-produced isolated squares 4×. The shipped profile is FITTED, not derived (§28). |
| `BuildingPlan`'s self-test covers 14,680 layouts | **FALSE — the number matches nothing, in any version of the file.** Measured by instrumenting `plan` and `recipe`: the current file makes **1,505 `plan` calls, 2,005 `recipe` calls, 9,456 rooms**; the 2026-08-19 version that coined the figure (`4bd8734`) makes **553 `plan` calls, 5,968 rooms**. Squares tiled by the basic test are 14,136 now, 6,072 then. Originated in `FINDINGS_E13_2026-08-19.md` and propagated unchecked into `CHUNKS.md` F3, `PROMPT_F1.md`, `PROMPT_BUILDINGPLAN.md` ×3 and this document ×4 (§40). |
| `BuildingPlan`'s self-test passes | **FALSE since commit `0247ddc`.** It reports `no corridor-shaped rooms  FAIL  worst 5.7  NORTH 40x20 bathroom[23,4 17x3]` and **exits 1**. The E13-era file genuinely passed (verified by checking out `4bd8734` and running it: `worst 3.7`, "all cases pass"); the hub rewrite added four larger footprints and the failure arrived with them. **Consequence for the port: matching Java means reproducing the failure and the exit code** (§40). |
| §35's aspect failure is `NORTH 30x6 livingroom[0,0 30x2]` at aspect 15.0 | **STALE.** The hub rewrite fixed the core-banding defect — `NORTH 30x6` and `WEST 30x6` now PASS. The live failure is `NORTH 40x20 bathroom[23,4 17x3]` at 5.7, which is a **private-room packing** defect in `packAcross`, not a core-banding one. §35 OPEN item 2 appears DONE; OPEN item 1 is what the 40x20 case now indicts (§40). |
| `BuildingPlan.WEIGHT`'s insertion order is a behavioural contract | **FALSE.** It is read only through `getOrDefault` (lines 1311, 2536, 2555); nothing iterates it. Reversing the C++ table left a 160,657-line digest byte-identical, so `std::unordered_map` would in fact be safe today. An insertion-ordered container was used anyway — the claim becomes true the moment anyone adds an iteration, and it costs nothing. The instruction in §39 was right for the wrong reason (§40). |
| `std::round` for `javaRound` is the mutation test for `BuildingPlan` | **FALSE — it cannot fail.** All six `Math.round` sites take provably non-negative arguments: instrumented and measured over the full corpus at **116,502 calls, 0 negative**. Every rounded expression is a function of `w`, `h` and a non-negative fraction; none involves `x` or `y`. A session following `PROMPT_BUILDINGPLAN` would mutate, see no diff, and wrongly conclude its oracle was broken (§40). |
| The two `STATE.md` copies have diverged (§37) | **FALSE — one is a strict subset of the other.** `diff` returns **zero** lines unique to the `PZMapCreation` copy: it is a stale snapshot frozen at §35, 3,344 lines against 4,867. §37's supporting figure was also wrong — water mentions are **38 vs 2**, not 7 vs 8. Not a divergence, a stale copy; no merge is required, only a pointer (§40). |

Known-stale, not yet cleaned up: `TreeScatter` / `TreePalette` still place
~7,800 trees the engine deletes; `WorldGenOverride.lua` is still written and is
superseded by the biome map.

**Do not re-derive this from a grep.** `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette` have
live callers in `GisCells` and `BiomeMapWriter`, and `treeAt` is genuinely
read and written into the square stack. That does **not** contradict the
line above: "superseded" here means the engine discards the output on load
(§9), not that the code is unreachable. A session on 2026-08-10 ran that
grep, found the callers, and wrongly concluded A2's premise was false. See
§20 for what the callers actually mean for the deletion.

## 14. Test log — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §14 on 2026-09-01.** Pre-port test log, tests 1-25, all before 2026-08-21. Every result that still matters is folded into §6-§13; the failures are in the §13 Corrections table.

> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§14)` references still resolve.

## 15. Todo — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §15 on 2026-09-01.** Superseded by `CHUNKS.md`, which is the index. Every open item here is duplicated live in §20, §25 or the CHUNKS tables; every closed one is history.
>
> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§15)` references still resolve.

## 16. Independent sources available for checking

These are the things that have caught every real bug. Use them before writing
code, not after.

- **Retail map data** — `"$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY"`, 4065 cells, via `Probe square`
  and `Probe findprop`.
- **The game's own Lua** — `$PZ/media/lua/server/WorldGen/` and
  `$PZ/media/lua/server/metazones/BiomeMapConfig.lua`. Plain text.
- **The decompiled engine** — `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/`, Vineflower
  at `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/vineflower.jar`.
  `grep -rl <symbol> --include='*.class'` finds the class first.
- **Artefacts the engine writes** — save `map/` chunk directory numbers, and
  `console.txt` for map registration order.
- **`Unjammer/PZ_Vanilla_map_b42`** — the whole vanilla map decompiled to a
  WorldEd project. A free regression corpus for TMX work when that starts.
- **PZ Reverse Mapper** (Nexus mod 337) — reads `.lotheader` and `.lotpack`,
  handles both 300 and 256 cells, rebuilds biomemaps. A second independent
  opinion on any cell.

### The eight bugs, and what caught each

1. **x/y transposition** — 4065 cells round-tripped byte-identical while every
   coordinate was mirrored. Caught by checking room rectangles against the tiles
   beneath them.
2. **`.pack` "verified"** — checked only against fixtures this project
   generated, which proves the reader agrees with the writer and nothing else.
3. **Wall encoding** — keying off `attachedN`/`attachedW` validated at 99.5%
   while being wrong. Decoration hangs on walls.
4. **chunkdata** — thousands of hypothesis tests on zombie population data.
5. **Spawn coordinates** — three sessions of in-game tests all measured a
   location 8,800 tiles from the map. Caught by reading the save's chunk
   directory numbers.
6. **Tree species art** — three iterations of species machinery built on the
   assumption that maps author species tiles. One `findprop` against a vanilla
   cell would have shown otherwise immediately.
7. **Ground tile weights** — measured from hand-authored Muldraugh and applied
   to procedurally generated land. The generator's actual recipe was sitting in
   readable Lua the whole time.
8. **Renderer scale heuristic** — showed trees as ground-level shrubs for two
   rounds, and 43 sprites as missing, because of a width heuristic and a
   hardcoded pack list.

## 17. Building orientation — the grid admits no rotation — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §17 on 2026-09-01.** Superseded and its premise refuted. §30 measured the rotation premise failing on rural data (33.3% in the best window against a predicted 'well over half'), and §31/§32 settled the real cause. The correction is in §13.
>

## 18. Session 2026-08-10 — A1 closed, and what it turned up — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §18 on 2026-09-01.** Session narrative. Its outcome — `outlineRoom` offsets CORRECT, A1 closed — is carried in §6 and CHUNKS A1; its two wrong beliefs are in §13.
>
> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§18)` references still resolve.

## 19. Wall vocabulary, and four attempts at an alignment test

### The wall orientation vocabulary — CONFIRMED (§17 check 2 closed)

From `PaletteScan "$PZ/media" walls_exterior_house_01` and
`--prop Facing`:

| Flag | Role | `edgeOf` |
|---|---|---|
| `WallW` | west edge | WEST |
| `WallN` | north edge | NORTH |
| `WallNW` | corner, renders both segments on one square | BOTH |
| `WallSE` | **pillar/post, owns no edge** (`PaintingType = pillar`) | NONE |
| `WindowN/W`, `DoorWallN/W` | openings in a wall | NORTH / WEST |

**No diagonal wall primitive exists in the tile vocabulary.** That is the
strongest available evidence for §17's constraint — stronger than counting
rooms, because it is a property of the art rather than of one town.

`Facing` is an OBJECT property: N/S/E/W across ~6,200 tiles (the chair at
42_40 16,33 has `Facing W`). No wall tile carries it, and no tile of any
kind carries a diagonal facing. Objects have four facings; walls have two
edges plus a corner and a post.

**The A1 classifier audits clean.** `wallOn` requires `isStructuralWall`
AND a matching `edgeOf`. `WallSE` returns NONE so pillars never counted;
`WallNW` returns BOTH, which is correct; overlays are excluded by
`isOverlay`. `edgeOf` reads declared `Wall*` flags rather than inferring,
so it sidesteps the §11 `attachedN` trap by construction.

**But `edgeOf` has a live bug.** Its final block falls back to
`attachedN`/`attachedW` — the proxy the method's own comment warns about.
Unreachable from `wallOn`, but `edgeOf` is public and A3 will call it on
neighbours, where a grime overlay would report `Edge.NORTH`. Listed in §15
as an A3 prerequisite.

### The corpus sweep — `roomgeom --all`, 4065 cells, ~78s

```
rects:        152317 total
   tested:     29928  (19.6%)
   untestable 122384  (80.3%)   under 4 on a side
   off-level:      5

untestable rects by shorter side:   1: 46482   2: 45928   3: 29974
```

**The 80.3% is the important number, not the alignment result.** Vanilla
rooms are decomposed into thin strips — 46,482 rects are 1 square wide.
Any validation rule reasoning about a rect's interior is inapplicable to
four-fifths of the corpus. **This constrains A4's design more than the
orientation question does.** A4 must work at 1xN.

Also: `prisoncells [193,203 5x54]` appears identically at z=0,1,2,3.
Multi-storey rooms repeat per level, so "room with no exit" has to treat
vertical connectivity separately from horizontal.

### Four attempts at the alignment test

Recorded in full so none is retried. The question: **is this rect's wall
geometry expressible as a rectangle at all?**

| # | Approach | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fraction of interior rows carrying a wall, exclude above 25% | **674 false positives.** On a 4-wide rect one partition is 33%. Flagged bathrooms, halls, barns and printed "off-axis rooms exist in vanilla" |
| 2 | Least-squares slope of per-row mean wall x; exclude slope~1, r2>=0.9 | **Cleared all 674 — and the known diagonal too.** The rect holds two parallel runs, so the per-row mean jumps (203, 220, 203) and r2 came out 0.227. Averaging destroyed the structure |
| 3 | Concentration: fraction of walls on the two densest lines, exclude below 0.45, either axis | GIS caught at 0.19/0.20. Vanilla down to **53 false positives** |
| 4 | Same, but require BOTH axes low (`&&` not `\|\|`) | **CONFIRMED 2026-08-11.** 0 non-aligned across 29,928 testable rects; all 3 GIS diagonals still caught |

**Attempt 4 is the first version to pass both calibration cases at once** —
the known positive is caught and every known negative is clear. Attempts 1,
2 and 3 each failed one side. The rule it encodes: *a diagonal spreads walls
across every line on both axes; a partition spreads on one axis only.*

Measured concentrations, before attempt 3 was written:

| Shape | north | west |
|---|---|---|
| GIS diagonal `[199,221 26x15]` | 0.192 | 0.200 |
| clean rect `weldingworkshop` | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| rect + one partition (synthetic) | 1.000 | 0.667 |

**Why attempt 4 should work.** Every one of the 53 survivors has one axis
at or near 1.00 and the other low — `prisoncells` 0.30/1.00, `stable`
1.00/0.38, `bathroom` 0.42/1.00. Partitions run parallel to one axis, so
they can only spread walls along one axis. **A diagonal is low on both by
construction** — all three GIS rooms are 0.19/0.20, 0.21/0.23, 0.43/0.29.

**The lesson worth keeping.** Three of four attempts produced a confident
printed conclusion from a broken measure, and two of those conclusions were
about vanilla's properties. §4 says a test that cannot fail proves nothing;
the corollary is that **a test which has never been run against a known
positive AND a known negative has not been calibrated.** Attempt 3 was the
first checked against both before shipping, and it was still wrong — but
wrong in a diagnosable way, because the failures came with numbers.

### Status of §17

Check 2 (vocabulary) is CLOSED and supports the constraint. Check 1 (does
vanilla ever go off-axis) is **still open**: the current best answer is no
off-axis room among 29,928 testable rects, but that is 19.6% of the corpus
and comes from a test that has been wrong three times. `FootprintSnap`
should not be designed on it yet.

**UPDATE 2026-08-11 — check 1 CLOSED, with a stated limit.** Attempt 4
returns 0 non-aligned across 29,928 testable rects while still catching all
three known GIS diagonals, so the test is calibrated on both sides rather
than only one.

The limit is real and should be quoted alongside the result: **the finding
covers 19.6% of rects.** The other 80.3% are untestable because they are
under 4 on a side, not because they are suspect — a 1-wide rect has no
interior for walls to spread across, so "expressible as a rect" is close to
vacuous there.

**Two independent lines now agree**, which is what §4 asks for: no vanilla
room is off-axis among testable rects, and no diagonal wall primitive
exists in the tile vocabulary at all (§19). The second covers the whole
corpus rather than a fifth of it, and is the stronger of the two.

**Conclusion for design: `FootprintSnap` should refuse off-axis footprints,
not warn.** The earlier "warn, not refuse" recommendation came from the
broken guard and is retracted (§13).

---

## 20. A2 scoping — the deletion is not wholesale

A2's premise is intact. `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces TREE/BUSH/PLANT
per tile on load (§9), so the ~7,800 authored trees are discarded whatever
our code does. The chunk is still worth doing, and the proof is still
"delete, regenerate, confirm nothing changes in game".

What the call sites add, from `grep -rn -e TreeScatter -e TreePalette
-e WorldGenOverride src/` on 2026-08-10:

```
GisCells.java:61        TreePalette.pick(ti, sprites)
GisCells.java:63        TreeScatter.place(g, treePal, SEED)   -> treeAt
GisCells.java:150-151   treeAt[gx][gy] pushed onto the square stack
GisCells.java:220       writeWorldGenOverride(mapDir, cellsX, cellsY)
BiomeMapWriter.java:74  TreeScatter.distanceToStructure(g)
```

**`BiomeMapWriter` depends on `TreeScatter.distanceToStructure`.** That is
grid geometry — distance from each square to the nearest structure — not
vegetation placement, and it is load-bearing for the biome map, which is
what removed the visible seam (test 27). Deleting the class outright breaks
the thing that most recently worked.

So A2 is three separable pieces, only one of which is a deletion:

1. **Delete `TreeScatter.place` and `TreePalette`**, and the `treeAt` write
   at GisCells:150. Move `distanceToStructure` to a geometry helper first;
   that move should be byte-identical on its own, which makes it a
   separately provable step.
2. **Stop writing `WorldGenOverride.lua`.** Independent of the above and
   testable with no code change at all: delete the file from the generated
   mod directory, load, compare. If nothing changes, the write goes.
3. **Open question, not cleanup.** Biomes drive vegetation in
   engine-generated terrain; we also write tree tiles into authored cells.
   Do both target the same squares? If the engine populates authored cells
   too, vegetation is being decided twice by different rules, and which one
   wins is a behaviour question worth knowing before the editor authors
   vegetation deliberately.

**Proof mechanism for step 1**, unchanged from the charter: hash every
generated file before and after.

```fish
find ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport -type f | sort | xargs sha256sum > /tmp/before.sha
# delete, rebuild, regenerate
find ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport -type f | sort | xargs sha256sum > /tmp/after.sha
diff /tmp/before.sha /tmp/after.sha
```

**Prediction: the lotpacks differ** — the tree tiles really are written, so
removing them changes our output. The claim under test is not "the bytes
are identical" but "the loaded map is identical", which is why this one
needs the in-game check rather than a hash alone. The hashes are still
worth taking: they say *which* files changed, and anything other than the
lotpacks changing would be a surprise worth chasing.

**The `gisimport` command line is not recorded anywhere in this document.**
It was needed twice this session and guessed wrong both times. Whoever runs
A2 should paste the working invocation into §6.

---

## 21. Ground is regions, not a per-square mix — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §21 on 2026-09-01.** Superseded three times over, by §24, §26 and §27. The per-square-mix model was wrong, the stacking model that replaced it was incomplete, and §26/§27 carry the mechanism that is actually implemented. Four corrections from it are in §13.
>
> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§21)` references still resolve.

## 22. `chunkGrid` is zombie density — CONFIRMED, and ours is empty

### The evidence, three independent lines

1. **Structural.** B41 reads `(width/10)*(height/10)` bytes into a field
   the legacy format literally names `zombieDensity`. B42 reads
   `byte[1024]` = 32x32 into `chunkGrid`. Same role, resolution moved from
   per-10-tiles to per-chunk.
2. **Value range.** Vanilla uses 0..10, matching the B41 field.
3. **Behavioural, 2026-08-11.** Zombies spawn on vanilla ground and none
   spawn on ours. The boundary sits exactly where our authored road ends.
   **This is the independent source §4 asks for — not more testing of the
   same kind.**

### The distributions

```
vanilla Muldraugh, 4,162,560 chunks:
  0 -> 4,013,741    1 -> 47,276    2 -> 72,702    3 -> 17,993
  4 ->     7,455    5 ->    448    6 ->    595    7 ->  1,579
  8 ->        91    9 ->    140   (10 present)

generated PZGisImport, 4,096 chunks:
  0 -> 4,096        (every byte, all four cells)
```

**96.4% of vanilla chunks are zero, so a zero-heavy map is normal.** The
defect is not that we have zeros; it is that we have nothing else. And the
nonzero values are far from uniform — 1, 2 and 3 carry most of the
population while 8, 9 and 10 together are about 0.005% of chunks. Anything
that writes these must not spread values evenly across the range.

### The trap, which is the same one as §21

That histogram is a **frequency** measurement. Reproducing it by rolling
per chunk would get the numbers right and the arrangement wrong — density
clusters around habitation, and a town cell and a forest cell are not two
samples from one distribution. **Frequency is not distribution**; this is
the third time that error has appeared in this project (§11 `attachedN`,
§21 ground groups, here).

### Three consumers now want the same thing

- **Ground groups** need to know whether a place is grass, dirt or road
  (§21).
- **Zombie density** needs to know whether a place is inhabited (§22).
- **The biome/zone map** already encodes something close to this and is
  written per tile (§6).

All three are asking *what is this place*, and **GIS land use already
answers it** — parks, fields, residential, industrial — from real data
rather than invented noise. That is a strong argument for building the
region layer once, as shared infrastructure, rather than solving ground and
density separately.

It is also the §2 test passing cleanly: a GIS feature that the editor needs
regardless of who authors the tiles.

### Testing a fix

Unusually clean: write plausible density, regenerate, walk the same
boundary, see whether zombies appear on our side. **Use a fresh world** —
a resumed save may have baked spawn data for chunks it has already seen.

### Note on `Probe lotheader`

It stops at tile names and does not print the chunk grid, though
`LotHeader` parses it. The histogram above came from `Probe survey`, which
takes ~90s on Muldraugh and prints nothing until it finishes when piped
through `grep`.

## 23. Density written — the mechanism works — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §23 on 2026-09-01.** Session log of writing zombie density. The outcome is one line and is carried in §22: the mechanism works and `chunkGrid` is written. §22 stays live because F6 ports the writer.
>
> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§23)` references still resolve.

## 24. Ground stacking — §21's model is incomplete — ARCHIVED

> **Moved to `STATE_ARCHIVED.md` §24 on 2026-09-01.** Superseded by §26. The stacking observation was right, the stated reason was wrong — a square carries one solid tile plus mask tiles with `FloorOverlay`. §13 carries the correction.
>
> Nothing was deleted. Section number kept so `(§24)` references still resolve.

## 25. Tree ownership — UNRESOLVED, and it blocks A2 step 1

A2 step 1 rests on the claim that the engine discards our authored trees.
**That claim is not established, and two findings point against it.**

### Evidence for (the original basis)

§9: `genMapSquare` deletes and replaces TREE/BUSH/PLANT per tile on load.
§11: the engine substitutes species and appearance for the generic
`vegetation_trees_01_*` tiles, so varied beautiful trees in game are
compatible with our writing generic ones.

### Evidence against

1. **`BiomeMapWriter`'s own scope note**, added when that class was
   written: *"WorldGen only generates chunks where
   `IsoChunk.hasEmptySquaresOnLevelZero()` is true. Since GisCells fills
   every square of every chunk, none of ours are generated, so the BIOME
   band may currently do nothing for us."* If WorldGen never runs on our
   chunks, it never places trees on them either.
2. **Our tree tiles are in the file.** `Probe findprop ... 200_200 tree`
   returns `vegetation_trees_01_8 / _10 / _11` with `tree 2`, at authored
   positions. `TreeScatter` wrote 7,797 trees and they are on disk.

These are not necessarily contradictory — `genMapSquare` and WorldGen
chunk generation are different mechanisms, and one could run while the
other does not. That ambiguity is exactly what `BiomeMapWriter` flags as
UNVERIFIED.

### The test, which was started and not finished

**Positional.** Pick authored tree squares away from the cell edge, convert
to world coordinates, walk that line in game.

- Trees at exactly those coordinates, bare ground between → **positions are
  ours.** `TreeScatter` is live and A2 step 1 must not proceed.
- Trees along the line at unrelated positions → **the engine re-scatters.**
  A2 step 1 stands.
- Dense forest everywhere → the engine is adding on top of ours, and a
  different test is needed.

A first attempt used cell 200_200 local x=0, which is world x=51200 and sits
on the map edge — not usable. Pick interior squares (local x roughly
120-180) instead.

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe findprop "$PZ/media" \
    ~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport 200_200 tree
```

World coordinate for cell 200_200 local (x,y) is (51200 + x, 51200 + y).

### Density in the screenshots is a hint, not evidence

7,797 trees over four cells is about 3% of squares. The forest in the
2026-08-11 screenshots looks considerably denser than 3%, which would
suggest the engine is adding trees rather than only substituting art for
ours. Not conclusive — canopy sprites overlap and hide bare ground — but
worth holding in mind when the positional test is run.

### A fifth mechanism: `Fix2xMap` rewrites tile names at load — CONFIRMED

Found 2026-08-13 while rendering a vanilla reference for E7, not by looking
for it. `IsoChunk` holds a static legacy-name translation table applied to
**every tile as the chunk loads**, before any of the mechanisms above run.
Three kinds of entry:

| kind | example | effect |
|---|---|---|
| direct rename | `vegetation_groundcover_01_0` → `blends_grassoverlays_01_16` | tile becomes a different tile |
| deletion | `vegetation_groundcover_01_6` → `""` | tile vanishes |
| randomised substitution | `vegetation_foliage_01_0..16` → `randBush` | resolved per load to `f_bushes_1_(64 + Rand.Next(16))` |
| randomised substitution | `vegetation_groundcover_01_18..23` → `randPlant` | resolved per load to `d_plants_1_(Rand.Next(4)*16 + Rand.Next(8))` |

Also covers `walls_exterior_house_01_20..31`, `walls_exterior_roofs_01_24..41`
→ `walls_exterior_roofs_03_*`, and several `location_shop_greenes_01_*`.

**Why this matters to §25 directly.** The "Evidence against" above rests on
`Probe findprop` returning `vegetation_trees_01_8 / _10 / _11` at authored
positions. Those names being **in the file** is confirmed and unchanged. But
what the engine renders for them is not necessarily what we wrote, because a
name in `Fix2xMap` is rewritten at load. **This does not resolve tree
ownership either way** — it adds a mechanism that must be ruled in or out
before the positional test's result can be interpreted.

**Check, before running the positional test:** grep the decompiled
`IsoChunk` for the exact tile names `TreeScatter` and `TreePalette` emit. If
any appear as `Fix2xMap` keys, the test is measuring the engine's
substitution, not its scatter, and the three outcomes listed above do not mean
what they say.

```fish
grep -n -e vegetation_trees_01 -e vegetation_foliage_01 \
    ~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/IsoChunk.java
```

**Falsifier for the whole concern:** if none of our emitted names are keys in
the table, `Fix2xMap` is irrelevant to us and this note can be closed.

### Do not start from the biome bands

§23 suggested reading `town/edge/forest/deep` as the region signal. That
still may be worth doing, but it assumes the region driver is distance
from structures, and this transect does not support that. Extracting the
banding into a reusable method is worth doing regardless — three consumers
want a region signal — but mapping grass groups onto it should wait for
the investigation.

## 26. Ground blending — CONFIRMED mechanism, and the rule

E3, 2026-08-13. Full document: `docs/E3_GROUND_BLENDING.md`. Deliverable was a
document; no code was changed. This section is the summary a future session
needs; the document carries the falsifiers and the unrun checks.

### Three layers, and a naming trap

| Layer | Tileset | Flags | Per square |
|---|---|---|---|
| **solid** | `blends_natural_01`, `blends_street_01` | `solidfloor`, `diamondFloor` | exactly 1 |
| **mask** | same sheets | `FloorOverlay`, `IsFloorAttached`, `FloorAttachment{N,S,E,W}` | 0–4 |
| **tuft** | `blends_grassoverlays_01` | `vegitation`, `MoveWithWind` | 0–1 |

`GroundPalette` calls the **tuft** layer "overlay" (`OVERLAY_SHEET`,
`Ground(base, overlay)`, `overlayRate`) and has never written a mask. Use
**solid / mask / tuft**; "overlay" is now ambiguous and will cause a
misimplementation.

Stack order is solid first, masks after, tuft last — CONFIRMED on ~60 squares
across two tilesets. `getFloor()` returns the first floor object and
`cleanChunk` reads `FloorMaterial` off it, so a mask written first would be
mistaken for the floor.

### The 16-tile block contract — CONFIRMED

Source: `PaletteScan "$PZ/media" blends_natural_01`, all 160 indices. Uniform
across all seven materials. For block base **B**:

| offset | role |
|---|---|
| B+0, B+5, B+6, B+7 | solid variants, interchangeable |
| B+1 / B+2 / B+3 / B+4 | corner masks N+W / E+S / S+W / E+N |
| B+8 … B+11 | side masks N / W / E / S |
| B+12 … B+15 | side masks N / W / E / S, second variant |

B = 0 `Sand`, 16 `Grass_Dark`, 32 `Grass_Medium`, 48 `Grass_Light`, 64 `Dirt`,
80 `Dirt_Grass`, 96 `Clay`. Indices 112–127 are a further side-mask set with no
solids; 128–159 have no sprites — UNVERIFIED what they belong to. Block
regularity does **not** continue past 111.

`blends_street_01` follows the same contract: (90,190) is `_53` `Road_04` solid
with `_26` (E) and `_25` (W) `Road_02` masks.

Convention throughout: **+x East, +y South**, matching §10.

### The mask rule — CONFIRMED

Source: contiguous 9×5 rectangle, 42_40, x=110–118 y=198–202. 45 squares,
21 masks, every one checked against its actual neighbours; none unexplained.

A square carries masks drawn from its **neighbour's** block. The mask names the
direction the other material lies in. With S = the set of orthogonal directions
whose neighbour carries the higher-priority material:

| \|S\| | encoding |
|---|---|
| 0 | no mask |
| 1 | one side tile |
| 2, adjacent | **one corner tile** — not two side tiles |
| 2, opposite | two side tiles |
| 3 | two corner tiles, sharing the middle direction |
| 4 | four corner tiles |

Side masks have two interchangeable variants; vanilla uses both on identical
geometry, so pick at random exactly as the four solid variants are picked.

UNVERIFIED: the multi-material case (no square measured bordered two different
higher-priority materials); the |S|=3 case rests on one sample.

### Blending is one-way — there is a precedence table

Not one `Grass_Dark` base square in the rectangle carries a mask. All 21 masks
are Dark-on-Medium, and the relation is not reciprocal. The higher-priority
material is drawn as a mask **onto** its neighbour.

Known: `Grass_Dark` > `Grass_Medium` (21 samples) · `Grass_Medium` > `Sand`
((60,200)) · `Road_02` > `Road_04` ((90,190)).

It is **not** block-index order — Sand is block 0 and loses to Medium at 32 —
so it must be measured. Three of twenty-one `blends_natural_01` pairs known.
UNVERIFIED whether masks cross tilesets at all.

### Region boundaries are dithered

Base materials, 42_40, D = `Grass_Dark`, M = `Grass_Medium`:

```
x:      110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118
y=198:   D   D   D   D   D   M   M   M   M
y=199:   M   M   D   D   D   M   M   D   M
y=200:   M   D   M   D   M   M   M   D   D
y=201:   M   M   D   M   M   M   M   D   D
y=202:   M   M   D   M   M   M   M   M   D
```

The two materials interpenetrate per square across 2–4 squares. Interiors stay
pure — §21's 16/16 identical `Grass_Dark` in 35_35 still holds. So the model is
**region → texture (variant choice) → dither (at boundaries) → mask**. Layers 3
and 4 are separate and both are needed: dither without masks is the
scattered-diamond defect at region scale; masks without dither gives a soft but
geometrically straight edge.

UNVERIFIED that dither is a convention rather than a 42_40 hand-painting quirk.
**Check before implementing it:** a contiguous rectangle across a region
boundary in a non-town cell.

### The engine's blending pass touches only the procedural seam

`zombie.iso.worldgen.blending.Blending`, called from `IsoChunk.update()`. The
gate is `!blendingDoneFull && !Arrays.equals(blendingModified, {t,t,t,t})`,
which opens on authored chunks — but the per-direction work is guarded by
`sourceChunk.isBlendingDoneFull()`, set true only in `genRandomChunk`. **So the
neighbour must be a fully procedural chunk.** Between two authored chunks
nothing happens.

`changeGround` replaces the solid floor with `tiles().get(0)` from the
neighbouring biome's GROUND feature, random depth 0–3 inward, along each of the
8 columns of the shared edge — a ragged feathering pass, not masking.
`maxDepth = 4` is a dead constant. `BlendDirection.defaultDepth` (N 7, S 0,
W 7, E 0) are min/max seeds for `genRandomSquare`, not a blend radius.

Consequences: we author every mask ourselves; the
`contains("blends_natural_01")` guard means our roads and building floors are
immune to seam replacement while our natural ground is not.

### WorldGen can only place solid tiles

`grep -rho -e 'blends_natural_01_[0-9][0-9]*' "$PZ/media/lua/" | sort -u`
returns 28 tiles, every one a solid. **No mask tile appears in any Lua file.**
The producers partition cleanly: features place solids, `Blending` replaces
solids, only the authoring tool writes masks.

### `Sand` mid-cell is land use — Q4 answered

(60,200) is Sand solid carrying `fencing_01_59`, inside room 78
`emptyoutside` rect [53,199 8×12]. North of it: `Road_04` at (90,190), and a
`shed` room at [89,177 3×4]. Fenced open ground between a road and a shed — a
yard or lot.

This strengthens §22: land use is what GIS import already knows, and
`emptyoutside` rooms and fence tiles are co-located with it. UNVERIFIED that it
generalises; one parcel is not a rule.

### Dirt can come back — Q5 answered

`dirt` and `dirt_grass` have full 16-tile blocks with the same mask vocabulary.
Vanilla alternating `Dirt`/`Dirt_Grass` per square in 35_35 is the texture layer
behaving normally. The test-27 objection stands as an argument against
*scattering*, not against dirt: gated to tracks, yards and unpaved roads, being
bare is correct.

### What to implement, in dependency order

1. A material **priority table**. Blocks everything; three pairs known.
2. A **region layer** from GIS land use, pure interiors.
3. A **dither pass**, 2–4 squares — after running its falsifier.
4. A **mask pass**, after every square's material is final. It is a pure
   function of the four orthogonal neighbours, which is the same shape as the
   editor's auto wall-joining (Charter §1). Worth writing once for both.
5. Restore **dirt**, gated to yard/track regions.
6. Keep the tuft layer; only its naming needs changing.

Two traps: mask tiles must be declared in the `.lotheader` tile table
(`GroundPalette.all` collects solids and tufts only), and the mask pass cannot
be folded into the per-square roll in `GroundPalette.roll()` because a square's
masks depend on its neighbours.

### Noticed, out of scope

`Blending.removeTrees` is a **fourth** mechanism touching trees: along an edge
shared with a procedural chunk it deletes trees with probability ramping by
distance from the edge (`rnd.nextInt(100) >= y*10` — certain at the edge,
impossible beyond 10 squares) and substitutes `e_newgrass_1_40` or
`e_newgrass_1_42` about 75% of the time. This bears on §25: authored trees near
the map edge may be deleted by this pass rather than by `genMapSquare`, which
would confound the positional test if it is run too close to the boundary.

### `CellRenderer` — two known limitations, neither affecting the game

Found while producing the E7 reference render. **Both are renderer-only. Map
data is correct in both cases and the game is unaffected.** Recorded because
Charter §4 says the renderer is a hypothesis too, and it has now been wrong
three times.

1. **No `Fix2xMap` translation.** `CellRenderer` looks tile names up in the
   sprite atlas literally, so any legacy name the engine would rewrite at load
   is reported missing and skipped. On a 9×9 pure-grass patch of 42_40 this was
   4 of 54 distinct sprites and 13 skipped draws — all vegetation
   (`vegetation_groundcover_01_21`, `vegetation_trees_01_8/9/10`), none of them
   `blends_natural_01`. Applying the table before atlas lookup would fix this
   and every future instance. Note the randomised entries cannot be reproduced
   exactly, only sampled.
2. **Tree sprite vertical anchor.** A tree renders with its canopy sitting flat
   on the grass and, at `zTo` > 0, its trunk hanging below the ground plane.
   The tile is correct — (118,196) carries `vegetation_trees_01_9` with
   `tree 2`, a genuine vanilla tree tile. `Z_STEP = 96` and the `oy` offset
   place tall sprites wrongly relative to the floor diamond. **Owner decision
   2026-08-13: ignore.** It does not affect the game and no chunk depends on it.

**What this does not compromise:** the E7 reference render
(`docs/` or `~/Downloads/vanilla_blend_tight.png`, 42_40 x=110 y=198 size 9).
Every missing sprite was vegetation; no ground tile failed to resolve, and the
ground reads correctly. The mask layer composites properly — `CellRenderer`
draws the full square stack in stored order onto an ARGB canvas, so transparent
mask art blends over the solid beneath it. **The renderer can validate E9.**

### Renderer invocation — two argument-shape traps

`Probe render` reverses the argument order used by `square`, `findprop` and
`roomgeom`, and wants a *texture pack dir* rather than a media dir:

```fish
java -cp out pzformat.Probe render "$MAPS/Muldraugh, KY" \
    "$PZ/media/texturepacks" 42_40 110 198 9 0 0 ~/Downloads/out.png
```

`$PZ/media` yields `packs loaded: 0` and every sprite missing. And in
`Probe.java` the guard on both `zFrom` and `zTo` is `args.length > 8`, so
**passing nine arguments silently ignores `zFrom` and falls back to z 0..2.**
Pass all ten.

## 27. Ground precedence — the priority table, measured

E7, 2026-08-13. Full document: `docs/E7_GROUND_PRECEDENCE.md`. Deliverable was
a document; the only code added was `pzformat.GroundCensus`, read-only.

Measured over **4,065 cells — the entire Muldraugh retail map** — at z=0, by
`GroundCensus`, which walks every square in one JVM run. §26's mask mechanism
came from a single 45-square rectangle; this tests it at corpus scale and fills
the four holes it left.

### The material priority table — CONFIRMED

The higher-priority material supplies the mask; the lower-priority square
carries it.

**`Grass_Dark` > `Grass_Medium` > `Grass_Light` > `Sand` > `Dirt_Grass` >
`Dirt` > `Clay`**

| pair | n | pair | n |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Grass_Dark > Grass_Medium` | 8,119,438 | `Grass_Light > Dirt` | 677,353 |
| `Grass_Medium > Grass_Light` | 3,424,535 | `Grass_Light > Dirt_Grass` | 284,699 |
| `Dirt_Grass > Dirt` | 1,319,008 | `Grass_Light > Sand` | 256,784 |
| `Grass_Dark > Grass_Light` | 615,314 | `Grass_Medium > Sand` | 67,082 |
| `Grass_Medium > Dirt` | 484,489 | `Grass_Dark > Sand` | 49,306 |
| `Grass_Dark > Dirt` | 484,001 | `Sand > Dirt` | 6,140 |
| `Dirt > Clay` | 1,119 | `Dirt_Grass > Clay` | 1,038 |

**Transitivity is observed, not inferred** — `Grass_Dark` is seen masking
directly onto all six materials below it. No skip link contradicts the chain.

**It is not derivable.** Block index order is 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96; the
priority order is 16, 32, 48, 0, 80, 64, 96. Not brightness either — dark grass
outranks light grass, but pale `Sand` outranks dark `Dirt`. **Hard-code it.**

Grass consistently outranks road (`Grass_Dark > Road_04` 284,583, and so on for
every grass/road pair). Roads among themselves:
**`Road_01` > `Road_02` > `Road_04` > `Road_03` ≈ `Road_05` > `Road_07` >
`Road_06`** — UNVERIFIED as strict, since `Road_03`/`Road_05` separate at only
24:1. `Burnt > Grass_Light` (2,608); `Burnt`'s wider position is UNVERIFIED.

### Priority is a strong default, not a law

**Every pair shows both directions.** The magnitude separates two regimes:

| pair | dominant | reverse | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Grass_Medium` / `Grass_Light` | 3,424,535 | 94 | 36,400 : 1 |
| `Grass_Light` / `Sand` | 256,784 | 86 | 2,986 : 1 |
| `Dirt` / `Dirt_Grass` | 1,319,008 | 94,696 | 14 : 1 |
| `Road_01` / `Road_02` | 495 | 63 | 8 : 1 |
| `Grass_Light` / `Road_01` | 137 | 55 | 2.5 : 1 |

For natural materials the reversals are a noise floor — hand-edits, or tool
re-runs over edited ground. **Vanilla is not internally consistent here and we
should not reproduce its inconsistency.** Author from a strict table. A
validator flagging "mask direction disagrees with the table" should fire on
roughly 1 vanilla square in 3,000; that rate is itself a check the table is
right.

### Dither is general — CONFIRMED

§26 flagged dither as possibly a 42_40 quirk. The prediction going into E7 was
that forest cells would show clean edges. **They do not.**

**Mean single-square-island share: 19.97% across all 4,065 cells.** A
single-square 4-connected component is one square of material A entirely
surrounded by B; no curved, diagonal or irregular edge can produce one. One
component in five is dither.

**E8's dither pass is required, not conditional.**

**UNVERIFIED — the dither's spatial law.** We know it exists and roughly how
dense it is. Random per square, noise-driven, or patterned? How does band width
relate to the material pair? **This is the one measurement E8 still needs.**

### Block contract, completed

| sheet | masks per block | layout |
|---|---|---|
| `blends_natural_01` | **12** | 4 corners B+1..4, 8 sides B+8..15 (two variant sets) |
| `blends_street_01` | **8** | 4 corners B+1..4, 4 sides B+8..11 (**one** variant set) |
| `floors_burnt_01` | 20 at 9–31 | same vocabulary, fire damage |

Natural blocks confirmed for all seven materials, not just the one E3 measured.
**Roads have no second variant set** — code assuming the natural shape will emit
`blends_street_01_12`..`_15`, which are not road masks.

**`Clay` is the exception:** 28 indices spanning 97–127 where the block predicts
97–100 and 104–111. CONFIRMED as observation, UNVERIFIED as interpretation.
Emit only 97–100 and 104–111 and it does not block anything.

### Masks cross tilesets, and multi-material squares are common

Both were untestable in E3. Both confirmed:

- `blends_street_01_48` (Road_04) carrying `blends_natural_01_24` (Grass_Dark N).
- `blends_natural_01_16` (Grass_Dark) carrying `industry_01_58`.
- `0_36 (7,94)`–`(7,179)`: a contiguous run of `Grass_Light` carrying **both**
  `Grass_Dark` and `Grass_Medium` masks.
- `42_40 (1,77)`: `Road_04` with `Grass_Medium` and `Road_01` masks —
  multi-material *and* cross-tileset on one square.

**The rule keys on `FloorMaterial`, not on tileset.** And E9's mask pass runs
once per distinct outranking neighbour material, concatenating the results —
§26's guessed extension, now confirmed.

### The discriminator, corrected

```
isBlendMask(tile) = props.has("FloorOverlay")
                 && props.has("FloorMaterial")
                 && props.hasAny("FloorAttachmentN","FloorAttachmentS",
                                 "FloorAttachmentE","FloorAttachmentW")
```

§26's layer table implies `FloorOverlay` alone is enough. It is not — decal
sheets carry it without `FloorMaterial`.

### What E8 and E9 implement — revised from §26

1. `GroundMaterial` priority table, absolute. **CONFIRMED, do not re-measure.**
2. Region layer from GIS land use (E8).
3. **Dither pass (E8) — now required.** Target ~20% single-square islands at
   boundaries. Spatial law still unmeasured.
4. Mask pass (E9), per §26's rule with four amendments: key on `FloorMaterial`;
   use the three-property discriminator; run once per outranking neighbour and
   concatenate; emit 8 masks for street blocks, 12 for natural.
5. Restore dirt (E10).
6. Rename `GroundPalette`'s "overlay" to "tuft" — now three meanings collide
   (mask, tuft, decal).

### Named checks not run

1. **The dither spatial law** — what E8 needs, and E7 did not measure.
2. `Road_03` vs `Road_05` — the weakest link in the road order, may be no order.
3. `Burnt`'s position in the wider order. One pair observed.
4. Clay 112–127 — extra variant sets, or an eighth material?
5. Whether the noise floor is spatially clustered. If the 1-in-3,000 reversals
   concentrate in particular cells they are hand-edits; if uniformly scattered,
   something systematic is being missed.

### Noticed, out of scope

`floors_burnt_01` carries `FloorMaterial Burnt` masks and participates in the
priority system. Fire damage uses the blend vocabulary — a **third** consumer
for E9's neighbour-rule engine, alongside ground and A3's wall-joining.

---

## 28. Ground regions and the dither law — E8, and the defect is fixed

E8, 2026-08-14. **This chunk built.** The scattered tan diamonds that opened E3
are gone; generated open country now reads as coherent grass with yards, verges
and softened boundaries. Render: `docs/e8_final.png`.

New code: `GroundMaterial`, `GroundRegions`, `DitherLaw` (read-only
measurement). Changed: `GisCells` takes ground from the region layer.
`GroundPalette` untouched — its tuft model is measured and sound.

### Part 1 — the dither law is INDEPENDENT PER SQUARE

§27 left this as the one measurement E8 needed. `DitherLaw` answered it.

**CONFIRMED.** Matched-distance lift, `P(both minority) / P(minority|d)²`
measured between adjacent squares **at equal signed distance** so a varying p
cannot manufacture a correlation:

| pair | window 5 | window 9 | window 15 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dark/Medium | 1.125 / 1.102 | 0.935 / 1.023 | 0.956 / 0.950 |
| Medium/Light | 1.137 / 1.100 | 1.012 / 1.007 | 0.947 / 0.956 |
| Dark/Light | 1.381 / 1.636 | 1.198 / 1.022 | 0.948 / 0.985 |

(x-adjacency / y-adjacency. They agree, so this is not a scan artifact.)

On the boundary contour, on 8,000+ pairs against 200–600 in the tails,
**adjacent squares are independent.** Two thirds of contour minority components
are singletons, mean size 2.06.

**The 5–10× lift at |d|>2 is a different population, not correlation.** A
single correlated field cannot give ρ≈0 at p=0.46 and ρ≈0.7 at p=0.085 —
mutually exclusive. Minority component size by distance settles it: 2.06 on the
contour against 4–165 further out, with singletons falling from 66% to 0%.
Those are **genuine small regions the majority filter smoothed away**, which is
also why P floors at 0.03–0.05 at |d|=8 instead of decaying to zero.

**So: no noise field.** Distance transform from the region edge, one Bernoulli
draw per square.

**Two failed approaches, recorded because both looked right.** The first
independence test pooled run-lengths across d=−8..+8 where p ranges 0.02–0.32;
a mixture of p values produces excess long runs *and* a deficit of k=1 runs
(observed ratios 0.65–0.84 at k=1) even under perfect independence. It could not
distinguish correlation from varying p. The profile is also strongly
filter-dependent — P(minority) at d=0 runs 0.318 → 0.421 → 0.455 across windows
5/9/15 — so **band width is UNVERIFIED** and only bracketed.

### Part 2 — what was built, and what the data would not support

`GisImport.Cover` is `{NONE, ROAD, BUILDING}`. **There is no landcover import.**
§22 and §27 both say "the import already carries land use"; that is true of
developed surfaces and false of everything else. So:

| source | material | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `NONE` far from anything | `Grass_Dark` | the 58.6% majority; one region |
| within 3 of `BUILDING` | `Sand` | §26 Q4 — 42_40's mid-cell Sand is a fenced yard between a road and a shed |
| within 2 of `ROAD` | `Grass_Medium` | §26 — Medium appears as a verge at 42_40 (60,200) |

**Multiple grass regions across open country are unbuilt for want of data, not
by choice.** A noise field would be inventing a driver E3 ruled out and §27 left
unsupported. Owner decision 2026-08-14.

`YARD = 3` and `VERGE = 2` are **guesses**, isolated as constants. The only
evidence is one hand-authored lot.

**Seeding.** `GisCells` seeds its `Random` per cell so a cell regenerates
identically regardless of its neighbours. The dither flip is therefore driven by
a **position hash**, not that sequential `Random` — otherwise the same world
square dithers differently depending on which cell is written, and every cell
border becomes a seam.

### The dither rate is FITTED, not derived

Vanilla's measured P(minority|d) cannot be used as an input flip probability —
different quantities. Four data points, cell 200_200, against vanilla 42_40:

| P[0] | 1 nbr | 2 nbr | 3 nbr | 4 nbr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **vanilla** | **53.6%** | **37.8%** | **7.3%** | **1.3%** |
| 0.00 | 63.0% | 36.6% | 0.3% | 0.0% |
| 0.06 (shipped) | 56.4% | 35.9% | 5.4% | 2.2% |
| 0.14 | 52.8% | 34.2% | 9.2% | 3.9% |
| 0.27 (derived) | 47.5% | 34.0% | 12.7% | 5.8% |

Shipped: `P = {0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.005}`.

**Strongly sublinear** — 0→0.14 buys 3.9 points of 4-neighbour, 0.14→0.27 only
1.9 more. Saturation: once a boundary square has flipped there is nowhere new
to go.

**There is no geometric floor.** P=0 gives 0.0% 4-neighbour and one island in
65,536 squares, refuting the prediction that yard corners and the road diagonal
would produce isolates on their own.

### OPEN — the shape mismatch we cannot tune away

**Vanilla's 3-neighbour and 4-neighbour targets cannot be hit simultaneously.**
The shipped profile straddles them: 5.4% against 7.3%, and 2.2% against 1.3%.
Every rate over-produces true isolates relative to 3-neighbour squares.

That is a **shape** difference, not a rate. Vanilla's minority squares form
short chains along the contour (mean component 2.06, two-thirds singletons);
ours are pure independent draws, which give proportionally more isolates.
**Lift ≈ 1.0 at d=0 is a weaker claim than matching the component-size
distribution**, and the gap between those two claims is exactly this residual.

**Check for a future session:** compare our minority component-size histogram
against vanilla's directly, rather than the differing-neighbour histogram. If
vanilla's chains come from its regions being hand-painted with softer shapes
than our geometric buffers, the fix is region shape, not dither.

### Predictions that failed, all four

Recorded because Charter §4 says a test that cannot fail proves nothing, and
because the ones that failed were the ones that taught something.

1. **Dither is a noise field.** Refuted — lift ≈ 1.0 at the contour.
2. **The band runs 3–5 squares.** Unscoreable; the profile is filter-dependent.
3. **Halving P halves the islands.** It moved 5.8% → 3.9%. Sublinear.
4. **A geometric floor of ~2.5% exists.** P=0 gives 0.0%.

What survived every check was the independence result. The rate is a curve fit
to four points and should be labelled as such wherever it is used.

### Verified numerically, not by eye

The difference between P=0.27 and P=0.06 is **barely visible in the render**
while the census channels moved by a factor of three. Tuning ground by eye would
not have found this. `GroundCensus` run against our own output is the check that
works; use it.

## 29. The mask pass — E9, and §26's four-layer model is complete

E9, 2026-08-14. **Built, verified against vanilla, verified against our own
output, and verified in game.** Ground material boundaries are now soft.
Render: `docs/e9_fixed.png`.

New code: `MaskRule` (pure), `MaskAudit` (read-only). Changed: `GroundMaterial`
gains sheets, per-material solids, variant-set counts and the seven road types;
`GroundRegions` gains `addMasks` and a bordered `build`; `GisCells` calls the
mask pass at all three ground sites; `GroundPalette`'s "overlay" renamed to
"tuft".

### The rule, confirmed over 22 million masks

`MaskAudit` walks every square of every named cell, computes the neighbour
materials, and checks what vanilla actually wrote. Over the whole Muldraugh map:

| geometry | encoding | share | n |
|---|---|---|---|
| \|S\|=1 | one side tile | 99.9% | 7.9M |
| \|S\|=2 adjacent | **one corner tile** | 99.4–99.7% | 4.45M |
| \|S\|=2 opposite | two side tiles | 99.6% | 3.1M |
| \|S\|=3 | two corners sharing the middle | 99.2–99.4% | **1,288,832** |
| \|S\|=4 | four corner tiles | 99.1% | 210,412 |

**§26's `|S|=3` and `|S|=4` clauses each rested on ONE observation.** They are
now the best-attested things in the project. The owner chose to measure before
building rather than implement on n=1 and fix later; it cost one session and
settled both.

**Unexplained masks: 0.809%** — a mask whose material is on no side. Not spread
evenly: three cells gave 0.033%, and two pairs dominate the total,
`Road_01 on Road_07` (71,936) and `Grass_Light on Dirt_Grass` (61,303). So the
residue is **clustered in specific cells**, which is the answer §27's open check
was asking for: they are localised authoring, not a broken rule.

**UNVERIFIED — a possible missing clause.** One probe found a diagonal-only
neighbour taking a **side** tile: 0_34 (117,210) is `Grass_Dark` carrying a
`Grass_Light` E-side mask, with `Grass_Light` at the NE diagonal (118,209) and
on no orthogonal side. **Not implemented** — n=1 is exactly what this session
just spent a measurement refusing to build on, and 0.8% is inside tolerance.
**Check:** extend `MaskAudit` to record diagonal geometry, ~20 lines.

### Roads

Seven road types added with their **real** shapes, which are not uniform:

| block | material | solids | masks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Road_01` | 0, 5 — **two only** | 8 |
| 16 | `Road_02` | 16, 21 — **two only** | 8 |
| 32/48/64/80/96 | `Road_03`..`Road_07` | four | 8 |

`blends_street_01` has **one** mask variant set; `blends_natural_01` has two.
Emitting B+12..15 for a road would write tiles that do not exist.

Roads join the material array so grass can mask onto them — §27 measured
`Grass_Dark > Road_04` at 284,583 — with ranks 0–6 natural and 10–16 road, so
every natural material outranks every road by construction. **The dither
explicitly skips road boundaries**: interleaving would put grass squares in the
carriageway and road squares in the field. A road edge is hard, softened by
masks only.

The mask belongs on the LOWER-priority square, so grass masks are written on the
**road** square. The road branch in `GisCells` had to call `addMasks` too; until
it did, the census reported no road pairs at all and the array change looked
inert.

### The N/W transposition

`MaskRule.Dir` was declared `N(0, -1, 0), W(1, 0, -1)` against a constructor of
`(ord, dx, dy)`. **N carried dx=−1 — it pointed west; W pointed north.** On a
diagonal boundary that put roughly half the mask art on the wrong edge of its
square and rendered as a regular sawtooth along the road.

Caught by: 200_200 (20,166) has `Grass_Medium` to its **north** at (20,165) and
carried `blends_natural_01_45`, a **west** side mask, its own
`FloorAttachmentW` confirming it. After the fix, `_40` with `FloorAttachmentN`.

The self-test now asserts the direction table directly — dx, dy, ord and
opposite() — so this cannot recur silently. 12/12 cases pass.

### Verified against our own output

`MaskAudit` pointed at `$GISMAP` rather than Muldraugh:

| geometry | encoding | share |
|---|---|---|
| \|S\|=3, all four orientations | the single correct encoding | **100.0%** |
| \|S\|=4 | `[1, 2, 3, 4]` | **100.0%** |
| unexplained masks | — | **0.000%** |

Vanilla runs 99.1–99.7% with an 0.809% unexplained floor because it carries
hand-edits; we author from a strict table, so our map is **more internally
consistent than Muldraugh**. `GroundCensus` agrees: Q1 holds exactly the
boundaries the region layer creates, all in the correct direction, and Q2 is
empty.

**This is the test that would have caught the transposition in one run**, and it
did not exist until after the render found it. `MaskAudit` works on any map
directory; point it at our output after any change to the mask path.

### Verified in game

A fresh world at the generated map shows grass bleeding onto the sand yard in
soft irregular fringes rather than stepping square by square — **the masks
render**. That closes §26's out-of-scope worry that `attachmentsDoneFull`
defaults to true and `applyAttachments` might never run on authored chunks. It
evidently does not block mask art.

The road reads as plain unmarked asphalt at 7 squares, correct for its Census
class `S1400` ("Co Hwy 26", half-width 3).

### OPEN

1. **Yards are much larger than `YARD = 3` suggests.** A large irregular
   footprint puts many squares within 3 of *some* part of it, and the union
   reads as an 8–10 square apron. Region shape, not mask behaviour. `YARD` and
   `VERGE` remain guesses isolated as constants (§28).
2. **The diagonal mask clause**, above.
3. `Road_03` vs `Road_05` still separate at only 24:1 (§27). Nothing depends on
   it yet.
4. The buildings are black slabs with no roof or interior detail — `TilePalette`
   writes one interior floor tile and nothing above. A-track, untouched here.


---

## 30. Building footprints — orientation is not a measurement problem

2026-08-14, following E9. Measured with two new read-only classes,
`FootprintAngles` and `RoomShapes`. No code changed.

### The reframe: the target angle is known in advance

§10: a room is a union of `int32 x, y, w, h` rectangles. No rotation field, no
polygon, no vertex list. So **every wall runs due north-south or east-west,
and the target orientation is 0° — fixed by the format, not discoverable from
data.**

An axis-aligned edge lands exactly on the tile grid: no rounding, no steps.
**Jaggedness is not a defect in its own right, it is the SYMPTOM of an off-axis
edge.** The generated road demonstrates both halves — its straight runs are
perfectly clean and only its diagonal stretches stair-step.

Shape is free. L-shapes, T-shapes, wings and courtyards are all representable
as unions of rectangles. **Edge direction is not.**

This retires §17's search for a dominant grid. There is nothing to rotate *to*.

### §17's whole-scene rotation fails on this data anyway

`FootprintAngles` computes each footprint's minimum-area rectangle by rotating
calipers over its convex hull, takes the angle mod 90° (a rectangle's
orientation is 90°-periodic), and histograms area-weighted.

| # | angle | area m² | w × h m |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 76.16 | 122 | 12.3 × 9.9 |
| 1 | 37.08 | 158 | 16.1 × 9.9 |
| 2 | 71.15 | 173 | 23.5 × 7.4 |
| 3 | 37.79 | 219 | 14.9 × 14.8 |
| 4 | 65.05 | 76 | 12.3 × 6.2 |
| 5 | 61.18 | 301 | 22.2 × 13.6 |
| 6 | 80.27 | 341 | 19.8 × 17.2 |

Best ±3° window: **33.3%** of footprint area. §17 predicted "well over half"
for a grid town. **The prediction failed and the falsifier fired as written** —
flat means no single grid.

The reason is not a flaw in the method: at 39.05N 83.64W this is rural Ohio,
seven farmsteads over 1,391 m², each building squared to its own parcel. §17's
prediction was about a town and this is not one. **Whole-scene rotation may
still be right for a dense grid town; it is wrong here, and it is unnecessary
everywhere, because 0° is known in advance.**

`FootprintAngles` warns below 30 footprints. Three agreeing by chance looks
exactly like a grid.

### Vanilla's shape vocabulary — CONFIRMED over 90,827 rooms

`RoomShapes` over all 4,065 Muldraugh cells, reading lotheaders only:

| rects per room | share |
|---|---|
| 1 | **64.5%** |
| 2 | 18.7% |
| 3 | 9.7% |
| 4 | 4.1% |
| 5+ | 2.9% |

**93% of vanilla rooms are three rectangles or fewer.** Fill ratio (summed rect
area over bounding box) has median **1.000**, p10 0.714, and **64.5% are
exactly 1.000** — a plain rectangle.

**So faithfully tracing a real GIS outline would produce buildings MORE complex
than vanilla's.** An axis-aligned bounding box of the right area is closer to
what vanilla does than the true polygon would be. This is the finding that
decides how the snap works.

Bounding boxes are small: 1-4 × 1-4 dominates at 43,529, then 5-8 × 5-8 at
16,260. These are interior rooms — closets, bathrooms — not buildings.

### The type vocabulary is already enumerated

Room names across Muldraugh, by count: `bathroom` 16126, `bedroom` 11375,
`livingroom` 11222, `kitchen` 7725, `empty` 5704, `closet` 5397,
**`emptyoutside` 5242**, `office` 3976, `hall` 3749, `garagestorage` 1496,
`kidsbedroom` 1483, `derelict` 1339, `laundry` 1197, `janitor` 802,
`motelroom` 715, `diningroom` 694, `storageunit` 668, `garage` 588.

`emptyoutside` at 5,242 confirms §26 Q4: **yards are authored as rooms**, which
matters when we synthesise one around a building.

### The real gap is interior subdivision, not orientation

We write **8 rooms for 7 buildings** — one open box each. Vanilla writes a
cluster per building: bathroom, bedroom, livingroom, kitchen, closet. That is
what makes a building read as a building, and it is what "drop a real building
of the right type on the footprint" actually requires.

### So the snap is not a rotation

Given the above, `FootprintSnap` takes a GIS footprint and returns an
**axis-aligned rectangle of matching area at the same location**, tagged with
the occupancy class the import already carries (`Agriculture`, `Residential`).
Orientation is 0° by construction, so jaggedness cannot occur. Outline fidelity
is deliberately discarded because vanilla has less of it than the source data
does.

### §17 check 1 — ANSWERED. The axis constraint is HARD.

Open since 2026-08-10. `RoomShapes` with a corrected detector — three or more
rects stepping consistently in the same direction, not merely a pair — over all
90,827 Muldraugh rooms: **107 runs, 0.12%.**

And the 107 are not staircases. Every one is a room whose boundary *widens*
step by step:

```
2_38  hall       [118,33 4x1] [116,34 6x1] [114,35 8x1]
21_48 cave       [275,190 3x1] [274,191 8x1] [273,192 10x1] [271,193 12x1]
21_48 cave       [304,153 19x1] [302,154 21x1] [300,155 21x1] [298,156 8x1]
```

Rows 4, 6, 8 wide: the left edge steps left while the rect grows. That is a
splayed or funnel-shaped room, and the third example widens then collapses — an
irregular cavern outline. **Every individual edge is still north-south or
east-west. Not one off-axis wall exists in 90,827 rooms**, because the format
cannot express one.

What varies is how finely an author chooses to approximate a curve with steps,
and they do so rarely and mostly in caves, where a ragged natural outline is
the intent.

**Consequence for E5: `FootprintSnap` may REFUSE off-axis input outright.**
There is no vanilla practice it would be rejecting. A person drawing a diagonal
wall in the editor should be told no.

**And it sharpens what our buildings do wrong.** Ours stair-step because a
polygon was rasterised. Vanilla's 107 step because an author chose to
approximate a shape. Same visual primitive, opposite provenance — and the
difference is exactly what E5 removes.

Note `min(w,h) == 1` is **30.52%** of vanilla rects and is *not* a jaggedness
signature on its own. Corridors, closets and wall-thin rooms are all one square
wide by design.

### OPEN
1. **Rooms per building, and which types co-occur.** A `Residential` recipe is
   bedroom + bathroom + kitchen + livingroom; `Agriculture` is something else.
   This is the subdivision recipe and it has not been measured. `LotHeader`
   rooms carry no building id, so it needs a clustering pass — adjacent rooms
   sharing walls — or reading `objects.lua`.
2. **Room size targets.** Our footprints are 76–341 m² at one square per metre;
   vanilla's building bounding boxes have not been measured, only its rooms'.


---

## 31. Buildings are rectangles now — E5, and two wrong diagnoses first

2026-08-14. `FootprintSnap` added; `GisImport` rasterises snapped rectangles
instead of polygons. Verified by `Probe roomgeom`, by render, and in game.

### The defect

`Probe roomgeom` on our own map excluded **all 3 rooms** in 200_200 as *"not
axis-aligned"*, with north-wall concentration **0.19–0.43** where an aligned
building gives ~1.0:

```
'room' [103,89 14x14] z=0 — north conc 0.43 (28 walls), west conc 0.29 (28 walls)
```

The room rect was a clean 14×14 bounding box. Its 28 north-wall squares were
scattered along a diagonal outline. **The room and its walls described
different shapes** — that is the black slab with a ragged fringe in game.

Cause: `GisImport.fillPolygon` wrote the true polygon at 37–80° into
`Cover.BUILDING`; `deriveWalls` traces `Cover.BUILDING`; `GisCells` computed
the room rect independently as a bounding box.

### Two wrong diagnoses, and what corrected them

**First** I proposed snapping the room rects. `RoomShapes` pointed at our own
map killed it immediately: 8 rooms, 8 rects, fill ratio 1.000, zero
staircases. The room rects were already perfect rectangles and snapping them
would have changed nothing.

**Second** I proposed deriving walls from the room rect. That would have given
straight walls over a floor that still followed the polygon — the interior
would not have filled the room.

**Both were caught by `Probe roomgeom`, which already existed**, already had
"excluded as not axis-aligned" in it, and already cited §17. Nobody had pointed
it at our own output. Same lesson as `MaskAudit` in §29: **an instrument built
to measure vanilla works just as well on our map, and running it there is what
catches implementation bugs rather than model bugs.**

### The fix

`FootprintSnap.snap` returns an axis-aligned rectangle preserving the
footprint's **area** and **centroid**, with aspect ratio from the minimum-area
enclosing rectangle — so a long barn stays long, it merely stops being rotated.
It scales to the polygon's area rather than the enclosing rectangle's, which
would otherwise inflate every building by roughly 1/cos of its angle.

`GisImport` fills that rectangle. `deriveWalls` then traces a rectangle and
emits four straight runs, so **floor, walls and room rect describe the same
shape by construction** and jaggedness cannot occur.

Self-test: an already-aligned 10×6 comes back byte-identical — the snap is a
no-op on good input, which matters for the editor caller.

### Results

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `roomgeom` 200_200 | 0 measured, 3 excluded | **3 measured, 0 excluded** |
| north / south / west | 0.19–0.43 conc | **100.0%** |
| 200_201 and 201_201, all four sides | — | **100.0%** |
| building tiles | 1,530 | **1,391** |
| derived walls | 278 N / 256 W | 244 N / 156 W |

1,391 matches `FootprintAngles`' measured total footprint area of 1,391 m²
exactly — area is preserved to the square.

In game: a single unbroken wall run along the north face, a clean corner,
another straight run down the east. No steps anywhere.

### OPEN

1. **East wall 63.0% in 200_200 only** (17 of 27), against 100% in both other
   cells. The off-by-one alternative scores 0.0%, so it is not a convention
   error — 10 walls are simply absent. Likely two buildings adjacent in x,
   where the shared boundary correctly gets no wall. Local, not `deriveWalls`.
2. **The yard apron may be too wide.** `YARD = 3` measured from a rectangle
   covers more ground than from a thin polygon. **Measure it before changing
   it** — the road looked far too wide in three separate renders and was
   exactly the 7 squares its Census class specifies. Isometric projection
   makes a strip read wider than it is.
3. **Interior and roof are still absent.** `TilePalette` writes one interior
   floor tile and nothing above, so a building is a black void with walls. Now
   the most visible defect, since straight walls no longer distract from it.
   A-track, and E13's subdivision work sits on top of it.


---

## 32. The scale is verified, and the snap keeps its precision

2026-08-14, immediately after §31. Prompted by adding an area cross-check that
fired on its first run.

### One PZ tile is one metre — CONFIRMED to 0.4%

The footprints are FEMA/ORNL USA Structures, and every feature carries its own
`SQMETERS`. Comparing that against the tiles we write is a free check of the
entire projection-and-snap path, and it did not exist until now.

**Total building tiles 1,409 against `SQMETERS` summing 1,403** over seven
footprints — 0.4% over. Before the precision fix it was 1,391, 0.9% under.

Every import since the first has assumed one tile is one metre. **Nothing had
ever verified it.** It holds.

### Two quantisation losses were stacking, both downward

The check reported a worst case of **27.9%** — a building the dataset records
at 83.3 m² rendered as a 12×5 = 60 tile rectangle.

**First loss: `GisImport.project` rounded every vertex to an integer tile
before `FootprintSnap` could measure the polygon.** All seven footprints
measured below their recorded area — 122.5 against 127.4, 164.0 against 169.1,
175.0 against 179.8 — never above. A systematic 2–7% shave, and unrecoverable
downstream because the precision was already gone.

**Second loss: the rectangle's two sides were rounded independently.** A few
percent on a large building; dominant on a small one, where a single square is
a large fraction of a 6-wide side.

### The fix

`projectExact` keeps sub-tile precision and buildings use it. **Roads keep the
integer `project`** — `thickLine` walks tile centres and wants them.

Rounding now **rounds the longer side and derives the shorter from the area**,
rather than rounding both. Independent rounding discards the one quantity that
matters.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| total tiles vs `SQMETERS` 1,403 | 1,391 (−0.9%) | **1,409 (+0.4%)** |
| worst single building | **27.9%** | **13.5%** |
| 15% warning | fires every import | silent |

The 13.5% residual is not ours. That footprint's polygon measures 77–81.5 m²
depending on projection origin, so the dataset's own 83.3 sits ~5% above the
geometry it ships with. We round 77 down to 72: one square on a 6-wide side,
the irreducible cost of an integer grid.

### Why this was worth fixing rather than muting

A 5% area error is invisible in game. What made it worth an hour is that **the
check would have fired on every single import**, and a warning that always
fires is one that gets ignored — which is precisely how the `findprop` 3-hit
cap (§27) and the confounded run-length test (§28) each survived a full
session. A check that cries wolf is worse than no check.

### The import carries far more than we were using

Every USA Structures feature has 36 properties; we read one. Now carried into a
`GisImport.Building` record, for E13's interior recipes:

| field | why |
|---|---|
| `OCC_CLS` | the coarse class. Vocabulary is small — Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Agriculture, Education, Government, Utility, Religion, Assembly, Unclassified — so a per-class recipe is tractable, not a taxonomy problem. |
| `PRIM_OCC` | the finer class. Duplicates `OCC_CLS` on this rural extract; in a town it splits Commercial into retail, office, restaurant. |
| `OUTBLDG` | flags an outbuilding. Null on all seven here, but it is the barn-versus-farmhouse distinction, and a barn wants one undivided room. |
| `SQMETERS` | the dataset's own area — the cross-check above. |

`HEIGHT` is null throughout this extract, so storeys cannot be derived from it.

This extract holds `Agriculture` ×1 and `Residential` ×6, at 39.05N 83.64W in
Highland County, Ohio.

### OPEN

1. **`FootprintSnap.hull` can return a duplicate vertex.** Observed on the
   83.3 m² footprint: `[88,-143]` appeared twice in the hull. Harmless for the
   minimum-area rectangle, but it means near-degenerate rings reach the
   rotating calipers, and on a smaller building two vertices could merge
   entirely. Andrew's monotone chain with `<= 0` should collapse collinear
   points; it did not here.
2. **`$GISMAP` silently empties** between fish sessions and has now cost three
   round trips, failing differently each time — `NoSuchFileException` on a cell
   name read as a path, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and empty output
   under `2>/dev/null`. Set it in the same command as any probe that uses it.


---

## 33. The building recipe — measured, and the rule that governs it

2026-08-14. Three read-only classes: `RoomCluster` (rooms into buildings, then
size-conditioned types, parcel companions and host distance) and `HallRule`
(what distinguishes a building with a hallway from one without). No code
changed.

### The governing decision — owner, 2026-08-14

**GIS is authoritative for what exists. Gameplay is additive.**

Every real footprint stays a real building of its real class. Where the game
needs something the data does not supply, it is **added and attached to a GIS
building** — a garage beside a house, a barn near the farmhouse — rather than
reclassifying a house into a shed.

Two reasons, and the second is the stronger one:

1. Real-world data does not balance for gameplay, and this is going in a game.
   **Room type IS loot type**: `garagestorage` gates tools and fuel,
   `farmstorage` gates seed. A town of nothing but houses is one where whole
   item categories never spawn, so the *tail* of the distribution is
   gameplay-critical and must not be rounded away.
2. Reclassification destroys the provenance distinction permanently and
   invisibly. Additive placement keeps the two sources separable, so a future
   session can always ask which buildings came from data and which we added.

**Consequence:** a synthesised building must record its host, so a parcel stays
a parcel. `GisImport.Building` needs a provenance field — cheap now, impossible
to reconstruct later.

### Clustering rooms into buildings

`LotHeader` rooms carry no building id, so rooms are unioned when their rects
touch or sit one square apart — one square because a wall lives on the shared
edge. Unioned across floors too, since a two-storey house is one building.

Over 4,065 cells: **9,038 buildings from 85,585 interior rooms**, plus 5,242
`emptyoutside` yards excluded (they touch several buildings and would bridge
them into one blob).

**Known limits, both inflating the tail:** a terrace or strip mall merges into
one building, and a building straddling a cell boundary counts as two. The
floors histogram shows the damage — 17, 24, 28 "floors" are downtown blocks
unioning vertically. **Do not read floor counts off this.** Room counts and
type sets are unaffected.

### Size predicts type, strongly

Sampling the global mix unconditioned would give 80-square garages and
12-square houses. It does not:

| footprint | n | most common |
|---|---|---|
| ≤24 | 2,049 | **`garagestorage` 52.0%**, `empty` 10.2%, `shed` 3.6% |
| 25–60 | 1,477 | 4-room dwelling core 20.2%, +closet 14.4%, `garagestorage` 12.4% |
| 61–120 | 3,293 | **5-room core 28.5%**, 4-room 11.8%, +office 4.3% |
| 121–240 | 1,084 | core + garage + hall + laundry 4.5%, `barn` 3.7% |
| 241–480 | 663 | core + kidsbedroom 22.2%, `empty + producestorage` 5.0% |
| >480 | 472 | fragmented — `catwalk + railroadrepair`, warehouses |

The dwelling core is `bathroom + bedroom + closet + kitchen + livingroom`,
14.2% of all buildings; without closet 7.7%; with kidsbedroom 4.5%. **Counts
when present:** bathroom 2.75, bedroom 2.45, livingroom 2.39, kitchen 1.61 —
a house is two-ish bathrooms and bedrooms, one kitchen.

`garagestorage` alone is the **second most common building in Muldraugh at
14.0%**. The outbuilding case is a seventh of everything, not an edge case.

### What accompanies a dwelling, and how near

**45.1% of dwellings have an outbuilding within 40 squares; 37.8% specifically
have a `garagestorage`.** Then `shed` 2.6%, `picnic` 1.2%, `garage` 0.8%,
`farmstorage` 0.7%, `barn` 0.6%.

Host distance, Chebyshev between centres: **p10 8, median 18, p90 94.** The
type breakdown is what makes the 40-square cutoff meaningful rather than
arbitrary:

| type | n | mean | within 40 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `garagestorage` | 1,181 | 18.8 | **93.4%** |
| `shed` | 75 | 38.3 | 73.3% |
| `farmstorage` | 40 | 47.5 | 47.5% |
| `grocery` | 26 | 73.5 | 34.6% |
| `electronicsstore` | 25 | 90.7 | 24.0% |

A garage is genuinely attached to its house. A grocery is merely elsewhere in
town and the nearest-dwelling search found it anyway. **40 squares separates
"outbuilding of this parcel" from "unrelated building nearby".**

Measured per cell, so a host across a boundary is missed — biases the
distribution SHORT, never long.

### Vanilla's buildings are the same size as our footprints

p10 4×3 = 12, **median 10×8 = 80**, p90 18×19 = 342 squares. Our GIS
footprints are 76–341 m² at one square per metre — the same range. **Our
buildings are not too large**; they sit between vanilla's median and its p90.

### The hallway rule — room count, and the transition is at 6–7

`hall` appears in only 17.4% of buildings, so 82.6% connect door-to-door with
no corridor. A subdivider that always cuts a hallway would be wrong five times
in six. Five candidate discriminators were measured at once so the data would
pick:

| | with hall | without |
|---|---|---|
| rooms, median | **9** | **4** |
| area, median | 120 | 80 |
| aspect ratio | 1.27 | 1.33 |
| private room fraction | 0.50 | 0.50 |
| would route through a private room | **28.2%** | **1.9%** |

**Aspect ratio and private fraction explain nothing.** Room count separates:

| rooms | hall rate |
|---|---|
| 2–3 | **6.1%** |
| 4–5 | 14.4% |
| 6–7 | **57.3%** |
| 8–10 | 84.9% |
| 11–15 | 90.0% |
| 16+ | 87.5% |

**A clean sigmoid with the transition at 6–7 rooms.** Under 6, connect
door-to-door; from 8, use a hall.

The private-routing test is real but secondary — 28.2% against 1.9% is a 15×
ratio, so it is a genuine signal, but it fires on only a quarter of
hall-having buildings. **Access is the underlying reason; room count is what
predicts when access breaks down.** At 8+ rooms in a rectangle you cannot
arrange things so everything is reachable without either a corridor or walking
through bedrooms.

A further 17.0% of hall-having buildings become **adjacency-disconnected** with
their hall removed, against 0.0% of hall-less ones — for a third of these the
hall is structurally load-bearing, not merely convenient.

### What E13 now has, and what it still needs

**Measured and ready:** which rooms by footprint size; how many of each;
whether to cut a hall; what to add to a parcel and at what distance; that our
footprint sizes match vanilla's.

**Design settled:** sample the distribution rather than always taking the mode,
with guardrails so a small import is never pathological; `OCC_CLS =
Agriculture` gets a `barn` interior outright, because that is real data telling
us what the building is.

**Still unmeasured — the layout itself.** The recipe says *which* rooms, not
where. §30 found 93% of vanilla rooms are ≤3 rects and 64.5% exactly one, so a
recursive split into axis-aligned sub-rectangles should match the shape
vocabulary. Unverified: whether vanilla's internal walls span their region
(a BSP signature) or meet in T-junctions and pinwheels, and what the room area
ratios are by type — a bathroom is small, a livingroom large, and if those
ratios are stable the subdivider can allocate by type rather than splitting
evenly and labelling afterwards.

### OPEN

1. The layout measurement above.
2. **Every room must be reachable**, which is Charter §1's *"room with no
   exit"* validation seen from the other side. Generate it correctly and you
   can detect it — A4 should inherit whatever E13 builds, the way A3 inherits
   `MaskRule`.
3. Detached garages are **too small to appear in USA Structures at all** —
   bucket A is empty in our import. Every garage on our map will be synthesised.


---

## 34. Room layout — a BSP, plus a circulation pass

E14, 2026-08-14. `RoomLayout`, read-only. This is the last measurement E13
needed.

### The layout IS recursively splittable — 85.0%

Tested by trying to split: take the building's extent, look for a full-span cut
that no **rect** straddles, recurse on both sides, and check that every leaf
holds rects of one room only. That is the definition of a binary space
partition applied directly.

| rooms | splittable |
|---|---|
| 2 | **100.0%** |
| 3 | 98.3% |
| 4 | 93.3% |
| 5 | 86.0% |
| 6 | 76.3% |
| 7–12 | 77–85% |
| 13+ | 40–70%, noisy |

**Overall 85.0% of 8,580 multi-room buildings.** Falling with complexity,
never collapsing.

### The 15% that will not split is the HALLS

The failures are not pinwheels. They are one shape, over and over:

```
4_37  hall[9,135 10x1][11,136 8x1][17,137 2x1]
3_37  hall[25,222 4x1][25,223 3x2][23,225 5x1][20,226 7x1]
2_38  hall[173,128 7x1][175,129 2x2]
```

**A hall snakes.** Three or four thin rects stepping around corners, threading
between rooms. That cannot come out of recursive splitting, because the hall is
not a leaf of a partition — **it is the negative space left over after the
rooms are placed.**

### So the algorithm is: split, then carve

1. **Recursively split** the building rectangle to place the rooms. Allocate
   area by type using the ratios below, not evenly.
2. **Carve a hall** through the leftover, when room count says one is needed.

This matches §33 from the other direction. Halls appear by room count — 6.1% at
2–3 rooms, 57.3% at 6–7, 84.9% at 8–10 — and the BSP rate dips to 76–80%
exactly across that same range. **The two measurements are the same fact seen
twice**: where a hall is needed, a pure partition stops being sufficient.

### Room area by type — stable and strongly differentiated

`× mean` is the room's area over its **own building's** mean room area, so a
mansion and a cottage are comparable.

| type | × mean | median sq | p90 sq | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `closet` | **0.11** | 2 | 4 | 3,689 |
| `janitor` | 0.16 | 9 | 30 | 532 |
| `laundry` | 0.24 | 6 | 15 | 1,030 |
| `bathroom` | **0.27** | 6 | 12 | 11,406 |
| `office` | 0.60 | 27 | 90 | 2,741 |
| `kidsbedroom` | 0.81 | 15 | 24 | 1,153 |
| `bedroom` | **0.83** | 16 | 25 | 7,635 |
| `kitchen` | **1.03** | 24 | 30 | 6,649 |
| `diningroom` | 1.17 | 20 | 40 | 511 |
| `garage` | 1.26 | 30 | 48 | 527 |
| `lobby` | 1.50 | 28 | 99 | 332 |
| `livingroom` | **1.80** | 42 | 70 | 7,873 |
| `hall` | 1.83 | 40 | 126 | 2,764 |

A livingroom is **6.7× a bathroom**. Splitting evenly and labelling afterwards
would produce a house with a 42-square bathroom, which is the difference
between a plausible building and a grid of equal boxes.

The absolute medians are what E13 allocates from: bathroom 6, bedroom 16,
kitchen 24, livingroom 42, closet 2.

### The instrument was wrong first, and the check that caught it

The first run reported **10.5%** and I read it as "vanilla is not a BSP". It
split on **bounding boxes**. A room's box is not its shape — §30 measured 35.7%
of rooms as multi-rect, and an L-shaped livingroom's box swallows whatever
occupies the notch, so boxes overlap where the rooms tile perfectly.

**The tell was in the output and I nearly missed it: 2-room buildings scored
66.1%.** Two rooms failing to separate with a single cut is close to
impossible. A number that cannot be right is a statement about the instrument,
not the map — and after the fix it reads 100.0%.

Third time this pattern has cost a cycle: the confounded run-length test (§28),
the first diagonal-run detector (§30), and now this. All three produced clean,
plausible numbers that happened to agree with the hypothesis being tested.

### OPEN

1. **The carve step is unspecified.** We know a hall is thin (median 40 squares
   at 1.83× mean, so long and narrow) and that it snakes. We do not know how
   vanilla routes it — along one wall, down the middle, or wherever the rooms
   leave a gap.
2. **Multi-rect rooms are 35.7%** and a pure BSP produces only rectangles. Some
   of that is rooms wrapping a hall; the rest is unexplained. E13 can ship
   rectangles-only and look right; this is what would make it look *authored*.


---

## 35. Building interiors — E13, partly built and NOT finished

2026-08-14. **Read this section before touching `BuildingPlan`.** A great deal
was measured and most of it is sound; the room-list algorithm at the end is
mid-rewrite and demonstrably wrong. Both are recorded.

### What works, and is verified

**Interiors exist.** `BuildingPlan` produces typed room rects, `GisCells`
writes them into the lotheader and stamps room membership per square.
`RoomCluster` pointed at our own map reads back ~44 rooms across 8 buildings
where there were 8, with a rooms-per-building spread rather than 100%
one-room.

**Interior walls and doors.** A wall on the north or west edge of a square
wherever two rooms meet (§18's convention, as `deriveWalls` uses for
exteriors), verified by probe: exactly one wall per boundary, on the correct
square, in the correct orientation.

**Doors along a SPANNING TREE.** Cut one door per graph edge that first
connects a new room. A spanning tree reaches every node by definition, so **no
room can be walled in** — the guarantee is structural rather than
probabilistic, which matters because an unreachable room is invisible until
someone walks into the building. Charter §1 names *"room with no exit"* as a
validation rule; this is the same knowledge applied at authoring time, and A4
should walk the same graph in the other direction.

**Exterior doors exist and are correct in the data** — verified at 200_201
(43,69) and (43,84), each carrying `walls_exterior_house_01_1` (wall) plus
`_11` (door). **They are invisible in a render** because `CellRenderer` draws
the opaque wall sprite over them. Fourth time this session the renderer has
been the limitation rather than the map (§31, and the mask transposition, the
tree canopy, the road width before it).

**`TilePalette` gains interior walls and doors.** `walls_interior_house_01` is
a clean 16-tile block, same shape as the ground blends: B+0 `WallW`, B+1
`WallN`, B+2/3 corners, B+8/9 windows, **B+10/11 the doors**, B+12..15
variants. 436 tiles under `walls_interior` carry a `DoorWall` property.

### The house grammar — owner's rules, tested against Muldraugh

Stated as architecture, not as a distribution, then measured over 400 cells,
283 houses and 229 exterior doors (`HouseRules`).

| rule | vanilla | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| The exterior door never opens into a bedroom | **1 of 229** | **CONFIRMED, a law** |
| The livingroom faces the road | 62.5% | true but weak |
| The kitchen is opposite the livingroom | 58.7% | true but weak |
| Livingroom and kitchen may be open to each other | **55.4% fully open** | **the reverse of my prediction** |
| Small bedrooms share a bathroom rather than having ensuites | ensuite 6 vs 171 off-core | CONFIRMED |

**The entrance set is wider than livingroom and kitchen.** Of 229 exterior
doors: livingroom 31.0%, kitchen 26.6%, **hall 17.9%**, **laundry 9.6%**,
lobby 5.7%, diningroom 2.6%. The hall entrance is the front-door-into-a-hallway
house and the laundry entrance is the back door into a mudroom; both are common
enough to include, and both are now in `BuildingPlan.ENTRANCE`.

R1 and R2 are followed anyway despite being weak. A generator that is
consistent produces more coherent houses than vanilla's 62%, and nobody
complains that a town is too tidy.

### Room minimums — MEASURED, and this is what the rewrite needs

A median is not a minimum. `RoomMinimums` over 4,065 cells:

| room | p5 area | p5 short side | median area |
|---|---|---|---|
| `closet` | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| `bathroom` | 4 | **2** | 6 |
| `bedroom` | 9 | **3** | 14 |
| `kitchen` | 9 | **3** | 21 |
| `livingroom` | 16 | **4** | 32 |
| `diningroom` | 15 | 3 | 20 |
| `garage` | 25 | 5 | 30 |

**A bedroom is 3×3 minimum** — exactly the owner's stated 10ft × 10ft. A
bathroom is 2 on the short side. A livingroom will not go below 4 wide.

**Smallest house containing each room**, which is when the generator should
start adding it: livingroom, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom all at **30
squares** — so a 30 m² house has all four, confirming they are required rather
than optional. Then `laundry` 47, `closet` 48, `diningroom` 64, `office` 66,
`garagestorage` 69, `garage` 78.

### The layout algorithm — the aspect fix, which works

Rooms were coming out as strips: kitchen 15×3, closet 2×7, bathroom 2×10, worst
aspect 7.0. `split` always cut the longer side, which is right for a balanced
split and wrong for an unbalanced one.

**Trying both axes and keeping the better worst-case aspect** takes it to 4.0,
and a 12×10 house to 2.0 on every room. One extra arithmetic per split.

Weights also became §34's **measured median areas** rather than ratios to the
building mean — same ordering, proportions closer to what vanilla builds.

### WHAT IS NOT FINISHED — read this before continuing

**1. The room-list rule is mid-rewrite and wrong.** The owner's rule is:

> livingroom, kitchen, bathroom and at least one bedroom are REQUIRED and have
> minimum sizes. Further bedrooms are added until the space runs out. Closets,
> laundry and storage are the LEFTOVER, not peers with targets. If a room falls
> just short of its minimum, take the slack from a neighbour rather than
> shipping it undersized.

A prototype of that produced:

```
  76 sq ->  4 rooms   beds=1 baths=1
 122 sq ->  9 rooms   beds=3 baths=3     <- three bathrooms
 341 sq -> 13 rooms   beds=4 baths=4     <- same as a 173 sq house, 47% filled
```

Two defects, both plain: **bathrooms scale with bedrooms** when vanilla has
about one per house at these sizes, and the list **stops growing past ~173
squares**, so a 500 m² house gets the same 13 rooms at 32% fill. Do not ship
this. The measured minimums above are correct; the loop that consumes them is
not.

**2. `plan` still bands the core across the full frontage.** The aspect fix
reaches the secondary rooms inside the middle band but not the front and back
bands themselves. The self-test catches it: `NORTH 30x6 livingroom[0,0 30x2]`,
aspect **15.0**, and the suite fails on exactly that case. A 30×6 footprint is
rare and none of our seven are that shape, but the check is red and should stay
red until the core is placed as a block with a secondary room beside it rather
than as a strip.

**3. The elastic resize is unimplemented.** "If you need two more feet to make
the bedrooms 10×10, extend that part of the house" — nothing does this. Rooms
land wherever the partition puts them.

**4. Multi-storey is unimplemented and out of scope.** The owner's rules for it
are recorded and not built: half or more of the bedrooms upstairs, one bedroom
or office down, a bathroom on every floor. Nothing writes at z=1 and stairs do
not exist.

### Measurement caveats worth carrying

**The core-share numbers are unusable.** `RoomMinimums` reported 82.9% core at
≤50 squares, then 67.9, 65.7, 41.7, then **93.0% at 221–350** with a bedroom
median of 0 — non-monotonic and incoherent. Two causes: clustering merges
terraces and apartment blocks into one "house", and we read ground floor only,
so a two-storey house shows its livingroom and kitchen and none of its
bedrooms. **Use the per-room minimums, which are immune to this; ignore the
core share.**

The owner's "core is 25% of the house" does not need measuring anyway — under
the minimums rule it falls out. A small house is mostly livingroom and kitchen
because those hold their size while the bedroom count falls to one.

### OPEN

1. The room-list loop above.
2. Core placed as a block, not a band.
3. Elastic resize.
4. `CellRenderer` cannot show interiors — every wall is drawn at full height
   with no cutaway, so the rooms are occluded. Teaching it to draw walls at
   half height would make floor plans legible in a PNG, which matters because
   we will be looking at a lot of them.
5. `intDoorN` resolves to `walls_interior_house_01_107` while `intDoorW` is
   `_10` — the property test sorts alphabetically and `_107` beats `_11`, so a
   north and west door in the same wall are different styles. Pair doors to
   their block.
6. **The in-game test has not been run.** The doors exist in the data; nobody
   has walked through one.

### GIS — Japan/OSM source, and the discovery that GIS was never ported (2026-08-31)

Folded from `FINDINGS_GIS_2026-08-31.md`. Three things happened: a second data
source was added to the fetch script, a shipped feature was found to be
undocumented, and the C++ port was found to have deliberately excluded the whole
GIS pipeline.

#### `fetch_gis.py` now picks a source from the bounding box

US box → USA Structures + TIGER/Line, unchanged. Anything else → OpenStreetMap
via Overpass, which has global coverage. `--source us|osm` forces either. The US
path was not otherwise modified.

OSM buildings are mapped onto the **US vocabulary**: OSM tags translate to the
same `OCC_CLS` / `PRIM_OCC` fields USA Structures produces, so `GisImport` does
not know or care which country the data came from. Function tags beat the
physical tag — `building=yes` + `amenity=restaurant` → Commercial, not
Unclassified. `PRIM_OCC` keeps the OSM `key=value` that produced the class,
mirroring how PRIM_OCC splits Commercial in USA Structures.

OSM water is written as **`water.geojson`, not `rivers.geojson`**, because
`GisImport` auto-discovers that exact filename beside `buildings.geojson`. Each
feature carries an NHD-style `fcode` mapped from the OSM waterway type so the
existing `waterWidth()` switch picks a channel width without knowing the data is
not NHD: river/riverbank → 46000 (3 tiles), stream → 46006 (2), canal → 33600,
drain → 33601, ditch → 33603, default 46000.

`landuse.geojson` is fetched but nothing reads it — `Cover` has no landcover
type. Written so the data is on disk when one exists.

**US-side bug fixed in the same pass.** Road dedup was keyed on `LINEARID`,
which drops distinct segments of a road that crosses the box twice. Now keyed on
geometry, which is what §6 says it should be. The shipped script had regressed.

**Verified.** Ohio box unchanged: 7 buildings, 1 road, `Co Hwy 26` — matches the
dataset recorded in §6. Tokyo box (Moto-Akasaka, 305 × 171 m): 59 buildings, 17
roads, 1 water body, 8 landuse polygons.

#### CORRECTION — §980 and §2466 are wrong about `Cover`, and have been since 2026-08-21

Both say `GisImport.Cover` is `{NONE, ROAD, BUILDING}`. **It is
`{NONE, WATER, ROAD, BUILDING}`.** On 2026-08-21 a patch added `WATER` to the
enum, created `WaterTiles.java`, wired auto-discovery of `water.geojson` beside
`buildings.geojson`, and shipped: Little West Fork Ohio Brush Creek, 1 feature,
**1,486 tiles**, `blends_natural_02_0`, confirmed in game, committed and pushed.
Water wins over grass, loses to roads and buildings. Evidence: the enum at
`GisImport.java:38`, and `WaterTiles.java` on disk dated 20 Aug.

**The landcover half of §2466 remains TRUE** — there is still no landcover
import.

**The water work was never recorded anywhere.** A search across both repos for
markdown mentioning water/river/hydro/fcode/NHD found only the palette table and
passing references — no orphaned FINDINGS file, no partially folded section. A
shipped, in-game-confirmed feature went undocumented for ten days. Reading
§2466 as current in this session led to designing an enum extension that already
existed, costing a round trip. **Charter §4's "check what exists before building
anything" applies to our own tree, not only to vanilla.**

#### CORRECTION — the C++ port excluded the entire GIS pipeline

STATE's "Editor-track inventory (2026-08-21)" lists GIS plumbing as OUT OF SCOPE
for the port, and that is exactly what happened. A full file listing of the C++
repo contains no `Gis*`, no `GeoJson`, no `Json`, no `TilePalette`, no
`WaterTiles`. The only `Cover` match in C++ is `squaresCovered`, unrelated.

This was **correct under Charter §2 as written** — GIS was a side project that
had to justify itself by teaching the editor something. The owner has since
clarified (2026-08-31) that the GIS generator **ships with the application**, in
its own window reached from a menu item, because it is the path to a playable
map for **non-technical and disabled users** who want to make a PZ map without
learning TileZed. GIS remains a side project in the sense Charter §2 means —
the editor is still the main work — but "side project" no longer implies "not
shipped."

The port is tracked as **CHUNKS Track F**. Charter §2 amendment is the owner's
to make (Charter §5).

#### Consequence: GIS work happens in the Java tree

`Probe giscells`, `Cover.WATER` and `WaterTiles` exist **only** at
`~/Documents/PZMapCreation`. The editor is C++ at `~/Documents/PZMapMaker`.
"We don't use PZMapCreation anymore" is true for editor work and false for GIS
work. This split cost a round trip in this session and will again until Track F
lands.

Both repos carry their own `STATE.md` and `CHUNKS.md`, with different
water-mention counts (7 vs 8), so they have **diverged**. Two copies of an
append-only governance document is the drift condition Charter §5 exists to
prevent. Unresolved; the test is `diff` them.

#### UNVERIFIED — areal water probably traces a perimeter instead of filling

`GisImport` appears to walk each ring calling `waterLine` between consecutive
points, which draws an outline. Ohio's creek was linear so this never showed.
Tokyo's water body is `natural=water`, an **area**. If the loop is what it looks
like, a lake comes out as a ring of water with dry ground inside.

**The test:** generate Tokyo and look at the water. The fetch script marks areal
features `AREAL=yes` and prints the count so the case is visible rather than
silently wrong. Not yet run. Tracked as **E15**.

#### UNVERIFIED — whether OSM Japan can drive per-class recipes at all

The Moto-Akasaka box returned **Unclassified 58, Religion 1**. Most Japanese
buildings carry a bare `building=yes` with no `amenity`/`shop`/`office`, so there
is nothing to classify from. This is not a mapping bug — the single Religion hit
shows the mapping fires when tags exist — and that box is Akasaka Palace grounds,
where minimal tagging is expected.

**But it threatens every plan that keys off occupancy class:** E2 density by
class, §2777 wall and floor materials per class, biome per parcel, §2821 room
recipes. **The test:** fetch a commercial box (Shinjuku, Akihabara) and compare
the class histogram; businesses get tagged even where buildings do not. If a
commercial box is still mostly Unclassified, OSM Japan cannot drive per-class
recipes and the driver must be something else — footprint area,
`building:levels`, or road-class proximity. **Do not assume; measure first.**

#### LICENSING — OSM is ODbL, and shipping changes the posture

The US path uses federal public-domain data (USA Structures, TIGER/Line, NHD)
with no attribution requirement. **OpenStreetMap is ODbL**: attribution and
share-alike on derived maps. Any published OSM-derived map must carry
attribution; the generated mod does not. The fetch script prints the notice.

Shipping a generator inside the application is also a different licensing
posture than running a research script. Both feed **D3**, which is no longer a
someday-decision.

#### Noticed, out of scope

- **Roads render jaggy.** PZ ships dedicated road tiles with corner and edge
  variants the importer does not use. Same shape of problem as A3 wall-joining —
  it should **inherit E9's neighbour-rule engine**, not grow a second one.
  Tracked as **E17**.
- **`FINDINGS_E13_2026-08-19.md` is still in the C++ repo root.** Its content is
  folded (E13 ticked, §35/§36 carry it), so per Charter §5 it is disposable.
  Left alone; deletion is an owner call.
- **The `Probe render` invocation recorded in §6 takes a 64-tile crop**
  (`200_200 80 157 64 0 0`). Pasted as-is it looks like a nearly empty map. Use
  `0 0 256 0 0` for a whole cell. This cost a round trip.

#### What the next chunk needs to know

- **The GIS pipeline is Java-only and must be ported.** Track F.
- The C++ tree already has everything `GisCells` writes *through* — `CellData`,
  `LotHeader`, `LotPack`, `TileIndex`, `Square`, `CellEditor`, `MapProject` are
  ported and verified byte-identical. **The GIS port is pure logic and palette
  selection, not format work.**
- **The port has an unusually strong oracle:** run Java `giscells` and C++
  `giscells` on the same GeoJSON and diff the generated mod byte-for-byte.
  Charter §4's independent-source rule with no interpretation gap.
- **RNG will break that oracle if ported carelessly.** `GisCells` seeds `Random`
  per cell, and the dither flip is driven by a **position hash**, not the
  sequential `Random` (§28). `std::mt19937` will not reproduce
  `java.util.Random` — port the LCG explicitly or the diff never clears.
- `BuildingPlan` is a pure function with a standalone self-test over ~~14,680~~
  layouts (`java -cp out pzformat.BuildingPlan`). Port against that test.
- **The schematic PNG deferral resolves itself.** `GisImport` writes a PNG,
  which needs image encode that C++ std lacks; STATE deferred this for
  `CellRenderer` to keep the library layer dependency-free. Since the generator
  is **app layer**, Qt's `QImage` covers it and Charter §3 is unaffected.
- **Water and Japan both work in Java today.** Generating Tokyo does not wait on
  the port.

## FINDINGS — E13 (finish) — 2026-08-19

**Status:** complete — all three definition-of-done items met.

**What was done:**

1. **Room-list loop rewritten.** Bathroom scaling fixed (was 1:1 with bedrooms,
   now exactly 1.00 per house through 250 m², 2.00 above 341). Duplicate
   livingrooms and kitchens removed — §33's counts-when-present were inflated
   by the clustering artifact. Bedrooms grow via the measured count curve
   `(area - 90) / 55`, with type changed from a four-way lottery to all-bedroom.

2. **Core placement rewritten twice.**
   - First as a block-not-band fix (worst aspect 15.0 → 4.0), which exposed
     four stacked defects, each surfacing only after the one above was fixed.
   - Then fully rewritten to the owner's architectural rule (drawn 2026-08-18):
     public strip (livingroom on road, kitchen behind, spanning full depth) on
     one side, private zone (bedrooms by halving and re-measuring) on the other,
     hallway from 3 bedrooms up at 1 tile wide running lengthwise.

3. **Door fix.** `replaceTile` was appending the DoorWall onto the raster wall,
   leaving both on the same edge. Two wall objects on one edge leaves the plain
   wall winning for collision — the door was solid in game. Fixed: strips the
   matching wall before adding the door. The interior door pass was never
   affected (already wrote one or the other).

4. **In-game walk — the test that had never been run.** Walked through doors,
   walked houses, walked the barn. Houses "look fantastic" (owner). Doors open.
   Barn is one open room.

5. **Building directory.** Prints every building with OCC_CLS, area, rect,
   facing, room count, world coordinates during generation. Caught swapped
   Agriculture/Residential labels before in-game walk. Flags suspiciously
   small Agriculture and large Residential entries.

6. **Barn classification.** Agriculture → one open room with entrance flag.
   `barn`, `garagestorage`, `shed` added to ENTRANCE set. Single-room buildings
   now get `entrance=true`.

**Confirmed** (verified against vanilla data, decompiled engine, or in game):

- The door append was a MAP defect, not a renderer defect. §35's belief that
  vanilla door squares carry both Wall and DoorWall, confirmed from a probe,
  was true of the *tiles being present* but false of *the engine treating it as
  a door*. Two wall objects on one edge = solid. DoorProbe before/after and
  in-game walk confirm the fix.
- Full-height walls are CORRECT in game. The engine does its own cutaway.
  `walls_exterior_house_01_1` is the standard ground-floor exterior wall,
  identical to vanilla Muldraugh. The "too tall" appearance was CellRenderer
  having no cutaway — renderer-only, not a map defect.
- Every "the building looks empty" moment this session traced to the renderer's
  missing cutaway, not to the map. This has been chased four times across the
  project. It does not need chasing again.
- `FootprintSnap` does not corrupt occupancy labels. It does pure geometry
  (polygon → axis-aligned rect) and never sees OCC_CLS. The label swap was
  in the source GeoJSON.
- The GIS source (geojson.io drawing over county data) had Agriculture on the
  house and Residential on the barn. This is a data quality issue, not a code
  bug. No free building footprint dataset reliably classifies rural buildings.

**Unverified** (believed, not tested):

- Two-bedroom houses in vanilla open onto the livingroom with no hallway.
  §33's 4–5 room bucket puts halls at 14.4%, consistent with this, but the
  rate conditioned on *bedroom count* (not room count) has not been measured.
  The test: filter RoomCluster to type-set {livingroom, kitchen, bathroom,
  bedroom×2}, report fraction containing `hall`.
- SECOND_BATH_AREA = 240 (where a second bathroom appears). Guess, not
  measured. The check is `RoomCluster` bathrooms per house conditioned on area.
- Bedroom counts are still high for large houses (7 at 256 m², 14 at 484 m²).
  The measurement that settles it: condition RoomCluster's bedroom count on
  footprint area over vanilla. Prediction: vanilla is flat at 2–3 bedrooms
  regardless of house size.
- Storage fraction may be too high (~30% closet/laundry in some layouts).
  Same measurement pass would show vanilla's ratio.
- `LIVING_MAX_ASPECT = 2.0` controls when the public strip widens. Not
  measured against vanilla.

**Corrections** (something in STATE.md is wrong):

- §35 claimed exterior door squares carry both Wall and DoorWall and the
  engine draws the door over the wall → FALSE where it counts: two wall
  objects on one edge leave the plain wall winning for collision, so the
  square is solid. The tiles are *present* but the engine does not *interpret*
  them as a door. Evidence: DoorProbe before (FAIL: both present, door
  blocked) and after (PASS: wall stripped, door works) plus in-game walk.
- §35 OPEN 5 (door contract untested in game) → CLOSED. Doors work in game
  after the replaceTile fix. Confirmed 2026-08-19.
- §35's "13 rooms at 32% fill" for the 500 m² case was the discarded
  prototype, not the shipped recipe. The shipped code's version of the defect
  was different: it produced 11.49 rooms at 500 m² with bathrooms at 3.19/house,
  and rooms did not stop growing. The *type distribution* was wrong, not the
  count curve.
- §33's counts-when-present (livingroom 2.39, kitchen 1.61, bathroom 2.75)
  are inflated by the clustering artifact that merges terraces into one
  "building." A single dwelling has one of each. The same artifact made the
  core-share numbers unusable.

**Files changed:**
- modified: `src/main/java/pzformat/BuildingPlan.java` — full rewrite of
  layout engine (public/private split, hallway, halving, barn entrance)
- modified: `src/main/java/pzformat/GisCells.java` — door fix (replaceTile
  strips wall), building directory
- created: `src/main/java/pzformat/DoorProbe.java` — pre-flight door check

- Project repo: `~/Documents/PZMapCreation`
- Compiled classes: `~/Documents/PZMapCreation/out`
- GIS source data: `~/pzgis/buildings.geojson`, `roads.geojson`, `area.geojson`
- Generated mod output: `~/Zomboid/mods/PZGisImport/common/media/maps/PZGisImport/`

- Vanilla maps: `$PZ/media/maps/Muldraugh, KY/`
- Decompiled engine: `~/Downloads/ZOMBOIDSTUFF/decompiled/`
- Patches are delivered as Python scripts, run from the repo root
- Shell is fish — no heredocs, `grep` is aliased to `ugrep` (use `-e` per pattern)
- In-game tests need a NEW GAME, not a resumed save

**Noticed, out of scope:**
- Barn floor should be grass/dirt, not hardwood. One-line change in GisCells:
  when room type is `barn`, write `floorGrass` instead of `floorInterior`.
- Edge blending at map boundary — blocky chunk-sized squares where mod grass
  meets vanilla grass. Same technique as road-to-grass overlay masks, applied
  to the outermost chunks.
- Elastic resize (E13 item 3) — still undone, not blocking.
- CellRenderer cutaway (§35 OPEN 4) — still open, renderer-only, not blocking
  anything since the engine handles it correctly.
- No free building footprint dataset reliably classifies rural buildings.
  The building directory is the mitigation — makes errors visible, doesn't
  try to guess.

**What the next chunk needs to know:**
- E13 is DONE. The suggested order is now: **A2-gate → B1 → B2 → C1**.
- B3 (room decomposition) and B4 (openings) are largely superseded by E13's
  work — the layout engine and the door pass already do what those chunks
  describe. B3/B4 should be re-scoped or closed when B1/B2 resolve.
- The layout engine is a pure function in `BuildingPlan.java` with no
  dependencies. Its self-test runs standalone: `java -cp out pzformat.BuildingPlan`.
- 14,680 dwelling layouts pass with zero gaps, overlaps, corridor rooms, or
  missing core rooms.
- GisCells has no `main` — the entry point is `Probe giscells`.
- `$GISMAP` empties between shells. Set it every time. This has cost five
  round trips across the project.



## 37. F1 — the GIS port inventory, from a call trace (2026-08-31)


Folded from `FINDINGS_F1_2026-08-31.md`. Deliverable is
`F1_GIS_PORT_INVENTORY.md` in the C++ repo root: full table, three verdicts,
seven-step port order with a named oracle per step.

**Method.** Static call graph over all 65 files in `src/main/java/pzformat/`
(`PZMapCreation` @ `0247ddc`): comments and string literals stripped, class
names matched at word boundaries, transitive reachability computed from
`GisCells` — the target of `Probe.java:29`. Verdicts came from the trace, not
from STATE's editor-track inventory or E13's findings. Both lists were checked
against it afterwards.

### The shape of the port — CONFIRMED

24 files are reachable from `GisCells`. Ten are the already-ported format layer.
**14 units, 6,854 lines, are the GIS port.**

| unit | lines | unit | lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BuildingPlan` | 3,347 | `TreeScatter` | 210 |
| `GisCells` | 864 | `GroundPalette` | 206 |
| `GisImport` | 491 | `BiomeMapWriter` | 132 |
| `TilePalette` | 324 | `TreePalette` | 120 |
| `GroundRegions` | 308 | `Json` | 117 |
| `FootprintSnap` | 299 | `GroundMaterial` | 114 |
| `MaskRule` | 257 | `GeoJson` | 65 |

- **`BuildingPlan` has zero `pzformat` dependencies** and is 49% of the port's
  lines. It ports in parallel with everything else, against its own
  ~~14,680~~-layout self-test. (**Both figures WRONG — §13, §40. Real: 1,505
  `plan` calls, and the self-test FAILS.**)
- **No Lua parsing is needed.** `WorldGenBiomes` and `WorldGenFeatures` are
  reached only by `BiomePalette`, which has zero callers. All three SURVEY.
  This was F1's largest open cost question and it resolved the cheap way.
- **Six SHIPS units draw `java.util.Random`**, not one: `GisCells`,
  `GroundRegions`, `MaskRule`, `TreeScatter`, `GroundPalette`, `BuildingPlan`.
  The LCG is therefore its own port step, ahead of everything that draws.
- **No map-iteration-order hazard.** `GisCells` uses `LinkedHashMap` for
  `shared`; the one `HashSet` (`doorAt`, line 670) is membership-only.
- **The schematic PNG is not on the generation path.** `GisCells:48` calls
  `GisImport.rasterise`, not `run`. `java.awt` / `ImageIO` are reached only from
  `run`, which is the `Probe gisimport` diagnostic. F5 ports `rasterise`
  dependency-free. PNG encode is still needed once, for `BiomeMapWriter`.
- **E15's premise, by inspection.** `GisImport.java:150–157` walks each ring
  calling `waterLine` between consecutive points — a perimeter trace, no fill.

### CORRECTION — `WaterTiles` is a survey, not a port target

CHUNKS F4 lists it as one of three units to port. It has a `main`, takes a
`MEDIA_DIR`, prints tiles whose name or properties contain "water", and has
**zero callers** — `grep -l WaterTiles *.java` returns only itself. The shipped
water path is `GisImport.Cover.WATER` + `waterLine()` (line 416) with the tile
name resolved through `TilePalette`. The file that taught the rule is not the
file that applies it.

### CORRECTION — `GisCells` does not write through `CellEditor` or `Square`

STATE's 2026-08-31 "what the next chunk needs to know" lists `Square`,
`CellEditor` and `MapProject` among what `GisCells` writes through. The trace
shows `CellEditor`'s only callers are `EditDemo` and `RoomGeometry`; `Square`'s
are `CellData`, `CellEditor`, `EditDemo`, `PropsProbe`. `GisCells` manipulates
`CellData` directly through its own helpers (`appendTile:827`,
`replaceTile:790`).

**Consequence for F7, and it is not small:** the generator bypasses the
undo-capable edit layer entirely. A generated map cannot be undone in the
editor, so "generate into the open project" is different work from "generate to
disk", and F7 must say which it is.

### CORRECTION — there is no `fillPolygon`, so E15 is not small

CHUNKS E15 says areal water fill is "small if `fillPolygon` is reusable —
buildings already use it." Buildings do not use it. Buildings go through
`FootprintSnap.Rect` — snapped to rectangles (E5, §31) — and there is no
scanline fill anywhere in `GisImport`. E15 needs one written from scratch.

### CORRECTION — `writeWorldGenOverride` was never deleted

A2b is marked `✅ CONFIRMED INERT 2026-08-11` and §3 item 2 says to delete it.
It is still called at `GisCells.java:371`. Inert in game, still written to disk,
and it will appear in F6's byte-identical diff. Either delete it in Java first
or exclude `WorldGenOverride.lua` from the diff and say so.

### CORRECTION — §6's Java file inventory is badly stale

§6 lists roughly 35 files; **65 exist**. Missing entirely: `BuildingPlan` (the
largest file in the project), `GroundRegions`, `GroundMaterial`, `MaskRule`,
`MaskAudit`, `FootprintSnap`, `GeoJson`, `WaterTiles`, `DitherLaw`,
`HouseRules`, `HallRule`, `RoomLayout`, `RoomMinimums`, `RoomShapes`,
`HouseLayouts`, `RoomCluster`, `DoorProbe`, `GroundCensus`,
`ChunkDataAnalysis`, `Locate`. §6 does say "refresh the real list with `find`" —
that instruction is load-bearing and the list should carry a date.

### Confirmation, not correction — the survey lists were right

STATE's editor-track survey list and E13's findings both put `RoomLayout`,
`RoomMinimums`, `RoomCluster` and `DoorProbe` in the survey bucket. **The trace
agrees.** `HouseRules`, `HallRule`, `DitherLaw` and `HouseLayouts` join them;
all have zero callers and a `main`. E13's layout engine was inlined into
`BuildingPlan`.

### The port order

Leaves first. Steps 1–2 are DONE (§38).

| step | units | lines | oracle |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ✅ | `Json`, `GeoJson` | 182 | same file → same features, properties, ring order |
| 2 ✅ | the LCG (`java.util.Random`) | ~86 | fixed seed, 10⁶ draws match |
| 3 | `FootprintSnap` | 299 | its own `main`, line 256. Pure geometry, no RNG |
| 4 | `BuildingPlan` | 3,347 | its own `main`, line 2614, ~~14,680~~ **1,505** layouts — **and it FAILS** (§40) |
| 5 | `GroundMaterial`, `TilePalette`, `TreePalette`, `GroundPalette`, `MaskRule` | 1,021 | same `TileIndex` in → identical tile-name tables out. **First step needing a PZ media dir** |
| 6 | `GisImport` (`rasterise`), `GroundRegions` | 799 | identical `Cover` grid, cell by cell |
| 7 | `TreeScatter`, `BiomeMapWriter`, `GisCells` | 1,206 | **byte-identical mod output**, Ohio and Tokyo |

**CHUNKS Track F needs amending to match:** F4 drops `WaterTiles` and gains
`TreePalette`, `GroundPalette`, `MaskRule`, `GroundMaterial`; F5 gains
`GroundRegions`; F6 gains `TreeScatter` and `BiomeMapWriter`.

### OPEN

- **`TreeScatter` / `TreePalette` — port or delete?** The trace says SHIPS: both
  are called by `GisCells`, `TreeScatter` also by `BiomeMapWriter`. But A2a is
  BLOCKED on A2-gate and §3 says `genMapSquare` deletes ~7,800 of these trees on
  load. Porting 330 lines that may be dead is the wrong order. **Resolve
  A2-gate before step 7** — same argument as E15-before-F5.
- **Byte-identical PNG for `biomemap_X_Y.png`.** Qt `QImage` may not reproduce
  Java `ImageIO` byte-for-byte (colour type, bit depth, filter, zlib level).
  Test: encode the same pixel buffer through both and `cmp`. If it fails, step
  7's oracle compares decoded pixels, not file bytes — and that weakening should
  be recorded rather than discovered.

---

## 38. F2 + the LCG — first two port steps DONE and verified (2026-08-31)

Folded from `FINDINGS_F2_2026-08-31.md`. `Json`, `GeoJson` and
`java.util.Random` are ported to C++20, standard library only, and verified
against the Java tree.

### Verified three ways

| what | result |
|---|---|
| 10 GeoJSON datasets, Ohio + Tokyo | **byte-identical digests**, 15,000+ lines |
| RNG: 8 seeds × 5 generators × 200 draws | **8,000 identical** |
| Reproduced on the owner's machine, GCC 16.2.1 | all line counts matched the prediction exactly |
| Configured with `-DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Qt6=ON` | both oracles still build — the GIS layer is Qt-free |

Predicted digest line counts, for re-running later: area 6, buildings 294,
roads 219, water 66, tokyo 6, tokyo/buildings 3,701, tokyo/landuse 1,330,
tokyo/rivers 133, tokyo/roads 9,198, tokyo/water 1,302. A count mismatch is a
parse difference; a count match with `cmp` failing is a value difference.

### Both oracles were mutation-tested, not trusted

Charter §4: a test that cannot fail proves nothing.

- Replacing `javaDoubleToString` with `std::to_string` → immediate diff on
  `SQMETERS` / `SQFEET`.
- Replacing `nextInt(bound)` with the naive `next(31) % bound` → **1,575
  divergences out of 8,000**, with the `nextInt(64)` rows diverging from draw
  zero. **The power-of-two branch and the rejection loop are the whole risk in
  the LCG.** `nextDouble`, `nextLong` and `nextBoolean` are mechanical; a naive
  `nextInt` looks correct in isolation and diverges only on some seeds.

### Behaviours that had to be ported deliberately — CONFIRMED

- **`Json.asText()` has two numeric branches.** Integral doubles go through
  `(long)`, non-integral through Java's `Double.toString` — shortest
  round-trip, E-notation outside 1e-3 … 1e7, always a digit either side of the
  point. C++ has neither by default.
- **Java's `\u` escape path is exercised 675 times** across the real files.
  Java appends a UTF-16 code unit; the port decodes surrogate pairs and emits
  UTF-8. Verified against 日本語, 😀 (supplementary plane) and （）.
- **Duplicate JSON keys replace in place, keeping original position**
  (`LinkedHashMap.put`). Verified with `"dup":1,"dup":2` → `2` at position 1.
- **`Character.isWhitespace` includes 0x1C–0x1F**, which C's `isspace` does not.
- **Object key order is insertion order.** `GeoJson.props` depends on it; a
  `std::map` would silently reorder every property digest.

### KNOWN BOUNDED DIVERGENCE — measured, characterised, accepted

`javaDoubleToString` disagrees with Java on exactly the **twenty smallest
positive subnormal doubles** — raw bit patterns `0x1`–`0x14`, values 4.9E-324
through 9.9E-323. Java's legacy `FloatingDecimal` emits a two-significant-digit
form; `std::to_chars` emits the true shortest. Both parse back to identical bits.

- **Zero mismatches** over 1,048,293 random non-integral doubles spanning the
  full bit range; 8 of 3,000 across the subnormal sweep, all inside bits 1–20.
- **Unreachable from GeoJSON.** Smallest nonzero magnitude in the corpus is
  1.304. A property value would have to literally be 4.9e-324.
- Fixing it means porting Java's `FloatingDecimal`, which is large. Recorded
  rather than fixed. **Do not rediscover this as a mystery.**

### The oracle harness family — three patterns, not one

Reading the six `*Oracle.java` harnesses showed they are not one convention:

- **Pattern A — byte comparison.** `Oracle`, `TileOracle`, `PackOracle`,
  `CellOracle`. Emit a deliberately awkward synthetic artifact from one tree,
  read and re-encode in the other, compare bytes. Works because a
  lotheader/tdef/pack *is* bytes.
- **Pattern B — canonical text digest.** `ClassifyOracle` only. Sorted key set,
  one tab-separated line per entity, fixed field order, booleans folded into a
  bitfield, `-` for absent. **This is the template for everything in Track F**,
  because `Cover` grids, layouts and palette tables are not bytes.
- **Pattern C — scripted ops over a degenerate input.** `EditOracle`. Uses an
  *empty* `TileIndex` so nothing classifies and no branch can legitimately
  differ, runs a fixed op script, compares final bytes. **The model for steps 3
  and 4**: fixed input, fixed seed, serialise the result as a Pattern B digest.

`GeoJsonOracle` departs from Pattern B twice, deliberately: it does **not sort**
(feature order is the contract — `GisImport.buildings` is "in import order" and
per-building seeding indexes into it), and it emits **coordinates as raw bits**
(`%016x`), because comparing formatted coordinates would test two printf
implementations rather than two parsers.

### CORRECTION — the UTF-16 vs UTF-8 collation hazard is LATENT, not active

An earlier note in this session warned that Java's `String.compareTo` (UTF-16
code units) and C++ `std::sort` on `std::string` (UTF-8 bytes) diverge, and that
this threatened the GIS oracles. Measured across every real file: **zero
supplementary-plane characters**, and only two characters ≥ U+E000 (fullwidth
parens U+FF08/09). The divergence requires a surrogate pair to trigger, so it
cannot bite on this data. The digest is unsorted anyway, which removes it
permanently. Recorded as measured-and-bounded rather than deleted.

### CORRECTION — for F2, Ohio is the harder dataset, not Tokyo

Tokyo's OSM properties are **100% strings**. Ohio carries the only non-integral
doubles in the corpus: `LONGITUDE -83.63682085642414`, `SQFEET 1371.503`,
`SQMETERS 179.8132`, `lengthkm 1.304`. F6's "two datasets" rule holds for F2
too, for the opposite reason to the one stated there.

### CORRECTION — `VERIFY.md` §2 carries a belief this document corrected

`VERIFY.md` tells the reader to predict that `SPAN_LEVELS_MINIMAL` reproduces
every chunk. STATE's own correction records the opposite: the full-dataset
round-trip proved **`SPAN_LEVELS_FULL`**, 4,162,560/4,162,560 chunks, with
MINIMAL scoring 76%. A session following `VERIFY.md` would predict wrong, see
the "wrong" answer, and hunt a port bug that does not exist — in the one
document whose job is telling you what to expect. `VERIFY.md` §1 also references
`tools/Oracle.java`; there is no `tools/` directory, the Java oracles are in the
C++ repo root.

### Where the files live, and the layer decision

C++ repo root, flat, matching the existing convention. `json.hpp/.cpp`,
`geojson.hpp/.cpp`, `java_random.hpp` (header-only), `geojson_oracle.cpp`,
`rng_oracle.cpp`, plus `GeoJsonOracle.java` and `RngOracle.java` alongside
`Oracle.java` and the rest. The two `.java` files are **copied** into
`src/main/java/pzformat/` in the Java tree to compile.

**New CMake target `pzgen`**, not added to `pzformat`. Both sources compile
clean under the library's strict flags (`-Wshadow -Wold-style-cast`), so they
*could* have gone in `pzformat` — but Charter §2 puts the generator in the
application layer, and F5/F6 will stack `gisimport.cpp`, `giscells.cpp`, the
palettes and `groundregions.cpp` behind them. A separate target keeps the layer
boundary visible in the build file rather than only in the charter. Named
`pzgen`, **not** `pzgis`, to avoid colliding with the `pzgis` data repo and
`~/pzgis`.

`pzgen` must sit **after `pzformat` and before `find_package(Qt6)`** — it landed
inside `if(Qt6_FOUND)` first, which built fine only because Qt6 was installed.
The falsifier is `cmake -B /tmp/noqt -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Qt6=ON`
followed by building both oracle targets.

### Gotchas that cost time this session

- **A committed file landed EMPTY.** `GeoJsonOracle.java` was pushed at 0 lines.
  §"Build/run notes" already warns that dropped files sometimes land empty and
  to `wc -l` before building — it happened again, and this time reached a
  commit. An empty *oracle* fails in the worst direction: a later session finds
  no Java side, assumes it was never written, and rebuilds it differently.
  Guard: `find ~/Documents/PZMapMaker -maxdepth 1 -size 0 -not -path '*/.git/*'`
- **Files authored off-machine carry future timestamps.** Breaks Ninja
  ("manifest still dirty"). `touch` them after copying, before building. It does
  **not** affect `git add` — git tracks content, not mtime.
- **ugrep is POSIX-strict.** `grep -q "add_library(pzgen"` fails with
  "mismatched (" because the paren opens a regex group. Use `grep -F`. This is a
  second face of the GREP RULE already in CHUNKS.
- **The digest format needed control-character escaping.** The first version let
  a property value containing a tab or newline split across lines. Both sides
  corrupted identically so the diff still *passed* while comparing the wrong
  columns. OSM `description` tags do carry newlines. Fixed in both oracles.
  **`ClassifyOracle` has the same latent defect** if any tile `CustomName` ever
  contains a tab.

### OPEN

- **`strtod` vs `Double.parseDouble`.** Agreed on all 15,000+ coordinates
  (compared as raw bits) and 1,048,293 random doubles, but they are not
  *specified* to agree on hex-float or arbitrarily long decimal literals. Test:
  a generated file of pathological numeric literals through both.
- **Malformed input.** Both parsers are deliberately trusting and will walk off
  the end. Neither was tested there because neither is specified. Test:
  truncated and corrupt GeoJSON — then decide whether matching the crash matters
  or whether C++ should validate.
- `tokyo/` contains both `rivers.geojson` and `water.geojson`. `GisImport`
  auto-discovers only `water.geojson`, so `rivers.geojson` appears unread.
  Worth one line in E15.

### Handoff — SUPERSEDED by §40 (was: next is step 3, `FootprintSnap`)

**Next is port step 3: `FootprintSnap`** — 299 lines, zero dependencies, own
`main` at line 256, pure geometry with no RNG. **Then step 4: `BuildingPlan`** —
3,347 lines, 49% of the whole port, zero dependencies, own `main` at line 2614
over ~~14,680~~ **1,505** layouts (§13). Both are unblocked; the LCG they need is ported and
verified. Neither needs a PZ install — **step 5, the palettes, is the first
thing that does.**

`BuildingPlan` is the right chunk for a long uninterrupted session: it is the
largest single unit in Track F and it stands entirely alone.

---

## 39. Port step 3 — `FootprintSnap` ported, and a floating-point divergence accepted (2026-08-31)

Folded from `FINDINGS_F3a_2026-08-31.md`. `FootprintSnap` (299 lines) is ported
to C++20, standard library only. Pure geometry, no RNG, no dependencies.

### Results — verified on two machines, GCC 13 and GCC 16

| corpus | count | Rect divergences |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed cases from the Java `main` | 7 | **0** |
| Real projected footprints (Ohio + Tokyo buildings, landuse, water) | 379 | **0** |
| Randomised polygons | 20,000 | 122 (0.61%) |

- **Area arithmetic is exact.** With bit-identical inputs, `area()` bits agree on
  all 20,000. Shoelace, `dedupeExact` and centroid arithmetic carry no
  divergence.
- **Convex hull is exact.** Hull vertex counts agree on all 20,000.

### Two porting hazards, both predicted and both real

- **`Math.round(x)` is `floor(x + 0.5)`, NOT `std::round`.** They disagree on
  every negative half-integer — Java gives -2 for -2.5, `std::round` gives -3.
  Footprint centroids go negative near a cell origin, so this is reachable.
  Ported as `javaRound`. Without it the fully-negative fixed case fails.
- **`Arrays.sort` on an object array is a STABLE mergesort; `std::sort` is
  not.** The hull comparator ties on exact duplicate vertices, which
  `dedupeExact` does not remove — it drops only the closing vertex.
  `std::stable_sort` is required.

Also reproduced deliberately rather than "fixed": `centroid(p, area)` ignores
its `area` parameter (the denominator is recomputed from the *signed*
`shoelace`), and its degenerate branch accumulates onto already-nonzero
`cx`/`cy` instead of resetting them.

### ACCEPTED DIVERGENCE — `minAreaRect` edge selection under near-ties

`minAreaRect` computes `ang = atan2(dy,dx)` then `cos(-ang)` / `sin(-ang)`.
Java's `Math.*` permits 2 ulp and does not match libm. With bit-identical
inputs the resulting width/height differ on 2,385 of 20,000 polygons. Usually
harmless — but when two candidate hull edges give near-equal enclosing area the
`ar < bestArea` comparison flips and a different rectangle wins.

- **Rate 0.61%.** By hull size: 2.70% at 3, 0.81% at 4, 0.17% at 5, 0% at 6+.
- **Failure shape: the rectangle rotates 90°.** Java `[232,-5 1x10]` vs C++
  `[227,0 10x1]` — same area, transposed.
- **Zero occurrences on real data.** 379 real rings, no divergence.
- **CONFIRMED DETERMINISTIC.** Reproduced exactly — 122 Rect and 2,385
  `minAreaRect` divergences, the same lines — on GCC 13 and GCC 16, both
  x86-64/OpenJDK 21. This is a stable, reproducible difference, not chaotic
  noise. That is what makes it safe to accept.

**OWNER DECISION 2026-08-31 — option 2: ACCEPT AND DOCUMENT.** Not fixed.

**The fix exists and is verified**, should it ever be needed: `cos(-ang)` and
`sin(-ang)` are algebraically `dx/len` and `-dy/len`, which uses only division
and `sqrt` — both correctly rounded under IEEE 754 in each language. Tested with
bit-identical inputs over 20,000 polygons: **bit-identical, all 20,000.**

```java
// instead of: ang = atan2(dy,dx); c = cos(-ang); s = sin(-ang);
double dx = b[0]-a[0], dy = b[1]-a[1], len = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
if (len == 0) continue;
double c = dx/len, s = -dy/len;
```

**It must land in BOTH trees to help** — applying it to C++ alone makes them
more different, not less. It changes Java's output on the 0.61%, so E5's
recorded building results would shift slightly. **Trigger for revisiting: F6
shows an unexplained diff on real data.** That is the moment to apply it to
both trees, not before.

### CORRECTION — a cross-language oracle must not use transcendentals to build its corpus

The first measurement of this divergence reported 81 Rect differences and blamed
`minAreaRect` for all of them. **It was contaminated.** The corpus generator
itself used `Math.cos` / `std::cos`, so the input polygons differed between
trees *before* `FootprintSnap` ran. The tell was 33 "area bit" divergences —
impossible for pure arithmetic on identical points — and that impossibility is
what exposed the harness bug. Regenerated with raw `JavaRandom` draws only; the
real figures are 122 Rect, 0 area, 0 hull.

The first analysis also called the divergence triangle-only. It is not; it
decays with hull size.

**This applies to every remaining oracle in Track F: generate the corpus with
arithmetic and `JavaRandom` only.**

### Build wiring

`footprintsnap.cpp` joins the `pzgen` library; `footprint_oracle` joins the
`pzgen` `foreach` loop (the one linking `pzgen`, not the older `pzformat` one).
`FootprintOracle.java` lives in the C++ repo root and is copied into
`src/main/java/pzformat/` to compile.

```fish
set GJ ~/pzgis/buildings.geojson ~/pzgis/tokyo/buildings.geojson \
       ~/pzgis/tokyo/landuse.geojson ~/pzgis/tokyo/water.geojson
java -cp out pzformat.FootprintOracle /tmp/fp.java.txt $GJ
~/Documents/PZMapMaker/build/pz_footprint_oracle /tmp/fp.cpp.txt $GJ
```

**Predict:** 20,386 lines each. X 0 divergent, G 0, area 0, hull 0, Rect 122,
minAreaRect 2,385. **X=0 and G=0 is the pass condition.** Any X or G divergence
is new information and would force the fix above.

### Prep for step 4 — `BuildingPlan`, already scanned

- **No `atan2`, no `cos`, no `sin` anywhere in the file.** The transcendental
  divergence above **does not apply**. 
- **6 `Math.round` sites** (lines 798, 860, 1309, 1383, 2317, 2327). All need
  `javaRound`.
- **No `HashMap`, no `HashSet`, no `Arrays.sort`, no streams.** The only map is
  `WEIGHT`, a `LinkedHashMap` populated in a static block — insertion order is
  the contract, so C++ must use an insertion-ordered container.
- **Near-miss worth knowing:** `ENTRANCE` is `java.util.Set.of(...)`, whose
  iteration order is RANDOMISED PER JVM RUN in Java 9+. It is only ever used via
  `.contains()` (lines 108, 479, 537, 1795), never iterated, so it is safe. **If
  a future edit iterates it, Java itself becomes nondeterministic** and no
  oracle will ever clear.
- 10 RNG call sites; `JavaRandom` is ported and verified.

### Handoff — SUPERSEDED by §40 (was: next is step 4, `BuildingPlan`)

**Next is port step 4: `BuildingPlan`** — 3,347 lines, 49% of the whole port,
zero `pzformat` dependencies, own `main` at line 2614 over ~~14,680~~ layouts.
(**The 14,680 figure is wrong — see §13 and §40. The real count is 1,505 `plan`
calls.**) Needs `JavaRandom` (done) and no PZ install. Take it in a fresh
session with a clean context window; it is the largest single unit in Track F
and stands alone.

**Step 5, the palettes, is the first thing that needs the PZ install.**


---

## 40. Port step 4 — `BuildingPlan` ported, and five documents were carrying a number that matches nothing (2026-09-01)

Folded from `FINDINGS_F3b_2026-09-01.md`. `BuildingPlan` (3,347 lines, 49% of
Track F) is ported to C++20, standard library only. **Step 4 is DONE.**

### Results — verified on two compilers

| what | result |
|---|---|
| Ported self-test vs Java | **62 lines byte-identical, both exit 1** |
| `BuildingPlanOracle` digest | **160,657 lines byte-identical** |
| Layouts covered by the digest | **20,052** |
| Reproduced GCC 13.3.0 and GCC 16.2.1, OpenJDK 21 | identical both |
| `-DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Qt6=ON` falsifier | passed — Qt6 NOT found, both targets built 25/25 |
| Strict flags `-Wshadow -Wold-style-cast` | zero warnings |

**`BuildingPlan` has zero dependencies — proven by construction**, not by call
trace: `javac -d out src/main/java/pzformat/BuildingPlan.java` compiles the file
alone with no other source on the command line.

### THE JAVA SELF-TEST FAILS. Matching it means reproducing the failure.

```
no corridor-shaped rooms            FAIL  worst 5.7  NORTH 40x20 bathroom[23,4 17x3]
1 BuildingPlan tests FAILED                                          (exit 1)
```

Every document said this test passes. It has not passed since commit `0247ddc`.
**A port that prints "all tests pass" has diverged.** The C++ side reproduces
the failure, the message, and the exit code.

The defect is real and is §35 OPEN item 1 seen from a new angle: `packAcross`
gives every private room the full depth of the rear zone and splits only
across, so a wide shallow rear zone yields strips — a 17×3 bathroom against a
measured p90 of 12 squares (§34). **Do not fix it during the port; it would
break the only oracle.**

### The self-test is a WEAK oracle — this is the case for the digest

Ten deliberate mutations of the C++ port. **All ten left the self-test output
byte-identical**, because it prints only room counts, gaps and overlaps, and a
wrong layout that still tiles the footprint exactly is invisible to it.

| mutation | self-test | digest |
|---|---|---|
| `std::round` for `javaRound`, all 6 sites | not caught | **not caught — provably unreachable** |
| `WEIGHT` table order reversed | not caught | **not caught — lookup-only** |
| `findOptionalRoomFromEnd` walks forwards | not caught | 234 lines |
| nested `pick` in `recipe` reordered | not caught | 381 lines |
| `openBetween` loses its short-circuit | not caught | 31 lines |
| `reorderPrivateRooms` insert index → 0 | not caught | 900 lines |
| `laundry` dropped from `ENTRANCE` | not caught | 2,269 lines |
| `max(0, add)` → `max(1, add)` in `allocateWeightedSizes` | not caught | 27,583 lines |
| `vScore <= hScore` → `<` in `split` | not caught | 1,230 lines |
| `WEIGHT_DEFAULT` 15.0 → 16.0 | not caught | 5,622 lines |

Two mutations survived the digest and **both are equivalent code, not coverage
gaps**: `min(1, size)` before vs after the erase is identical whenever
`bath > 0` (which forces size ≥ 2), and `nextDouble() <= 0.35` needs an exact
hit on a non-dyadic rational. Recorded so a later session does not read them as
holes.

### THE LESSON — a corpus from the unit's own upstream cannot reach every branch

The first digest missed two of the ten and had to be strengthened:

- **`openBetween`** escaped because every non-core pair sat last in the test
  vector. `openBetween` short-circuits, so a port drawing unconditionally
  shifted the RNG stream — but nothing printed after the shift, so the digest
  was identical. Fixed by interleaving core pairs *after* non-core ones.
- **`reorderPrivateRooms`** escaped because **`recipe` always emits `bathroom`
  first**, making the bathroom-forward branch unreachable from any
  recipe-generated corpus. Fixed by adding 6,000 layouts built from arbitrary
  palette samples (digest section `P`).

This is the fifth appearance of the pattern that has cost a cycle each time —
§28's confounded run-length test, §30's first diagonal-run detector, §34's
bounding-box BSP test, §39's transcendental-contaminated corpus, and now this.
**Rule for the remaining Track F oracles: feed the unit inputs its real caller
would never produce, not only the ones it would.**

### Porting hazards — what was real and what was not

- **REAL: Java's `%.1f` rounds HALF_UP over the shortest round-trip decimal;
  C `printf` rounds half-to-even over the exact value.** `aspect()` returns a
  ratio of small integers, so ties like 27/20 = 1.35 are reachable and the
  disagreement is direction-dependent. `javaFormat1f` reproduces Java.
  **UNVERIFIED:** the corpus reports `worst 5.7`, where both agree, so this
  path is reasoned-to and not exercised. Test: force an aspect of exactly 1.35
  or 3.25 through the report line.
- **REAL: `trimSideRoomCount` and `reorderPrivateRooms` mutate their argument
  in place**; every other `trim*` takes a defensive copy at the call site. The
  by-reference / by-value split in the port mirrors that exactly.
- **NOT REAL: nested-argument evaluation order in `recipe`.** Flagged as a
  hazard (Java specifies left-to-right, C++ leaves function arguments
  indeterminately sequenced). It cannot bite: the outer `pick`'s draw is in its
  *body*, and C++ sequences all argument expressions before the body, so the
  inner call always draws first. The hoisted temporary was kept as
  documentation; the hazard claim was overstated.
- **LATENT ELSEWHERE: `javaRound` is not `Math.round`.** `footprintsnap.hpp`
  implements `floor(x + 0.5)`; Java stopped being that in JDK 7. Measured:
  `Math.round(0.49999999999999994)` returns **0**, `floor(x+0.5)` returns
  **1**. Unreachable in `BuildingPlan`, but **`FootprintSnap` rounds negative
  centroids** (§39), so it is live there. Not tested. A step-3 issue surfacing
  in step 4.

### Fourteen dead symbols — MEASURED, one occurrence each

`weightSum`, `sideAHasRoom`, `roomCountNeedsMoreCapacity`, `depthAxis`,
`findBedroomIndex`, `minRooms`, `ceilDiv`, `hallChance`, `A_LIVING`,
`A_KITCHEN`, `A_BED`, `A_BATH`, `MIN_BEDROOM`, `MIN_CLOSET` each appear
**exactly once** in `BuildingPlan.java` — their own declaration. `hallChance`
carries a comment saying it is retained because other code may call it;
**nothing calls it, in either tree.** All fourteen were ported and digested
anyway: deleting code during a port makes the oracle weaker for no gain.
Cleanup belongs in a later chunk, applied to both trees at once.

### The F6 contract with this unit is FIVE symbols

`GisCells.java` uses only `recipe`, `plan` (the 7-arg overload — never the
SOUTH-default one), `openBetween`, `Facing` and `Room`. Lines 86, 272–276, 285,
600–639, 703–747. The other forty-odd exported symbols exist for the self-test
and the oracle alone.

### Files — what now exists on disk

Created in `~/Documents/PZMapMaker` (repo root, flat):

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `buildingplan.hpp` | `Room`, `Facing`, `Rect`, constants, full API, hazard notes |
| `buildingplan.cpp` | the port |
| `buildingplan_selftest.cpp` | ported `main` + `check` + `javaFormat1f` |
| `buildingplan_oracle.cpp` | C++ digest side |
| `BuildingPlanOracle.java` | Java digest side — **354 lines, `wc -l` it** |
| `FINDINGS_F3b_2026-09-01.md` | folded into this section; disposable now |

**Cumulative `pzgen` sources after step 4:** `json.cpp`, `geojson.cpp`,
`footprintsnap.cpp`, `buildingplan.cpp`, plus header-only `java_random.hpp`.
**Oracle binaries:** `pz_geojson_oracle`, `pz_rng_oracle`,
`pz_footprint_oracle`, `pz_buildingplan_oracle`, `pz_buildingplan_selftest`.
**None of these are in `ctest`** — they are separate binaries and must be run
by hand. See `VERIFY.md` §4.

### Build wiring

`buildingplan.cpp` joins the `pzgen` library; `buildingplan_oracle` and
`buildingplan_selftest` join the `pzgen` `foreach` loop — the one linking
`pzgen`, **not** the older loop linking `pzformat`. `BuildingPlanOracle.java`
lives in the C++ repo root and is copied into `src/main/java/pzformat/` to
compile.

```fish
cd ~/Documents/PZMapMaker
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja; and cmake --build build

cd ~/Documents/PZMapCreation
javac -d out src/main/java/pzformat/BuildingPlan.java \
             src/main/java/pzformat/BuildingPlanOracle.java

# Predict 62 lines, IDENTICAL, and BOTH exit 1 — Java FAILS today
java -cp out pzformat.BuildingPlan > /tmp/bp.java.txt; echo $status
~/Documents/PZMapMaker/build/pz_buildingplan_selftest > /tmp/bp.cpp.txt; echo $status
cmp /tmp/bp.java.txt /tmp/bp.cpp.txt; and echo "SELFTEST IDENTICAL"

# Predict 160,657 lines each
java -cp out pzformat.BuildingPlanOracle /tmp/bpo.java.txt
~/Documents/PZMapMaker/build/pz_buildingplan_oracle /tmp/bpo.cpp.txt
cmp /tmp/bpo.java.txt /tmp/bpo.cpp.txt; and echo "DIGEST IDENTICAL"

# The falsifier. USE THE ABSOLUTE PATH — see the gotcha below.
cmake -S ~/Documents/PZMapMaker -B /tmp/noqt -G Ninja -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Qt6=ON
cmake --build /tmp/noqt --target pz_buildingplan_oracle pz_buildingplan_selftest

# A mutation that DOES fail, to prove the digest can fail. ~27,583 lines.
#   buildingplan.cpp: add = std::max(0, add);  ->  add = std::max(1, add);
```

### Gotcha — "run from the repo root" bites differently in a multi-repo block

§5 already says to run from the repo root. It cost time again here in a new
shape: the command block `cd`s into `PZMapCreation` for `javac`, so a later
`cmake -S .` resolved to the **Java** tree and failed with "does not appear to
contain CMakeLists.txt", then `/tmp/noqt is not a directory` as a cascade.
**In any block that spans both repos, use absolute paths rather than `.`.**

### §37's STATE.md divergence — RESOLVED, and it was not a divergence

§37 flagged two copies of `STATE.md` with "different water-mention counts
(7 vs 8), so they have **diverged**", and set the test as `diff` them. Done:
**`diff` returns zero lines unique to the `PZMapCreation` copy.** It is a
strict subset — a stale snapshot frozen at §35, 3,344 lines against 4,867. The
water counts are **38 vs 2**, not 7 vs 8. No merge is needed; the Java tree's
copy should carry a pointer to the canonical one rather than a second
lifecycle.

### OPEN

- **The `%.1f` HALF_UP path is unexercised.** See above.
- **`javaRound` vs JDK 7+ `Math.round` in `FootprintSnap`.** Live, untested.
- **The 40x20 aspect defect** — real, §35 OPEN item 1, must not be fixed until
  after F6 or the oracle breaks.
- **Fourteen dead symbols** await a cleanup chunk in both trees at once.

### Handoff — current as of 2026-09-01, supersedes §39's

**Next is port step 5: the palettes** — `GroundMaterial`, `TilePalette`,
`TreePalette`, `GroundPalette`, `MaskRule`, 1,021 lines. **This is the first
step that needs the PZ install**, since its oracle is "same `TileIndex` in →
identical tile-name tables out". Steps 1–4 needed no game files.

Note the OPEN carried from §37: **`TreeScatter` / `TreePalette` — port or
delete?** A2-gate should resolve before `TreePalette` is ported, on the same
argument as E15-before-F5. If A2-gate is still open, port the other four and
leave `TreePalette` for step 7.
